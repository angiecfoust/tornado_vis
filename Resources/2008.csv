The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.

The seasons first strong push of deep moisture moved into Iowa on the 25th with surface temperatures warming into the mid 80s and dew points surging into the upper 60s to low 70s.  Precipitable water values were near 1.5 inches.  The dry slot pushed north across the area the previous night as the warm front lifted north.  The primary surface low was located over northern Minnesota.  A cold front extended south from the low into northwest Iowa.  The airmass became very unstable by the mid afternoon hours.  MUCAPE rose to between 4000 and 5000 J/kg.  Lifted indices fell to -8 to -11 C.  There was a considerable amount of both DCAPE at 1000-1500 J/kg and cape in the -10 to-30 C. layer of the atmoshpere, between 400 and 600 J/kg.  The freezing level was around 13,200 feet.  The environment was quite sheared with effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range.  LCL values were between 1000 and 1500 meters.  The airmass was initially capped.  During the late afternoon hours, a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over north central into northeast Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly.  Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.  It was located south of the main tornado and was on the ground for a little over a mile in Grundy County.  Initial reports indicated 9 fatalities with 7 in Parkersburg (pop 1889) and 2 in New Hartford (pop 637).  There were at least 50 injuries, with 4 of those in critical condition.  Two of the fatalities occurred a few days after the tornado from injuries sustained in the tornado.  The last fatality occurred on 7 Nov.  A 61 year old female sustained injuries in the stairwell of her home when a 2 x 4 was thrown through her right side lung.  She was hospitalized and died several months later of complications.  Significant structural damage occurred across the southern end of Parkersburg and along a path to just north of New Hartford.  Numerous structures completely destroyed from Parkersburg to near New Hartford.  The tornado continued eastward to just north of the Waterloo and Cedar Falls area.  Significant damage also occurred north of Dunkerton where the tornado increased to its greatest path width. This storm also produced substantial straight line wind damage along the southern periphery of the storm just south of the tornado track.  News accounts indicated that a receipt from Parkersburg was found around 1915 CST 3 miles north of Prairie du Chien, WI, 109 miles to the northeast.  Receipits were also found in Clayton County at Elkader, and full scrapbook pages and photos were found in far northeast Bremer County at Sumner.  Preliminary estimates that straight line winds of 90 to 100 MPH occurred with this storm. At 1637 CST, the Waterloo Airport  recorded a 93 MPH wind gust. Survey results suggest that straight line wind damage was the cause of the severe damage at the recreational vehicle dealership north of Cedar Falls.  At least 627 homes were damaged, including 288 homes destroyed in Parkersburg, 88 in New Hartford, 15 in Hazelton and another 50 in Black Hawk County. In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.  The last F4 tornado to hit Iowa was in Union, Madison, and Dallas Counties with a 56 mile path length on 8 April 1999.  There was one other smaller tornado during the evening.  A tornado touched down in Clarke County and was on the ground for a short time southeast of Osceola.  After the initial thunderstorm area developed over north central and northeast Iowa, a large complex developed over southeast Nebraska. The two areas of storms filled in to form a squall line by the mid evening hours.  The complex over Nebraska then pushed east and northeast along the squall line.  A considerable amount of severe weather was generated during the evening as this occurred.  Along the squall line, high winds and hail were common with the dominant mode of severe weather being hail of up to golf ball in size.  As the MCS out of Nebraska advanced east, a tail extending south from the centroid took on a bow echo configuration and raced east across Iowa at 65 MPH.  Very high winds occurred with this feature with numerous locations reporting winds of 65 to 85 MPH.  Some of the higher winds included an 85 MPH wind gust in the Winterset area and numerous reports of 75 to 85 MPH winds from Madison, Dallas, Warren and Polk Counties.  Lightning struck a house in Ankeny.  The house was set on fire by the strike.",Iowa State storm chasers tracked a satellite tornado just south of the main EF-5 tornado.

In fact there was one tornado that was just as large and perhaps could have been just as damaging that was headed towards the small Kiowa county town but fortunately turned and dissipated.,"This extremely large tornado (1.8 miles wide) moved east and then turned northeast towards Kiowa county. Many power poles were taken down by the tornado.  It also caused EF3 damage to trees, two old houses, barns and it carried an oil tank battery 1.8 miles depositing it in trees.   There was at least 20 head of cattle killed by the tornado.  There was minor injuries received by a 20 year old male as he took refuge in his truck that was parked next to a baler inside a barn.  The barn was completely swept away leaving the young man with cuts from broken glass.  The baler that was left standing probably protected him and his truck from going airborne, if not rolling.  Also, there was serious injury to a male in a semi on highway 34 in the vicinity of 37.3327 N, 99.6344 W probably by the RFD.  Two other semis parked at this location rolled over but no injuries were sustained by the drivers.  This extremely large tornado moved into Kiowa county.  The radar signature was eerily similar to the Greensburg tornado that occurred on May 4, 2007.",CSV

The seasons first strong push of deep moisture moved into Iowa on the 25th with surface temperatures warming into the mid 80s and dew points surging into the upper 60s to low 70s.  Precipitable water values were near 1.5 inches.  The dry slot pushed north across the area the previous night as the warm front lifted north.  The primary surface low was located over northern Minnesota.  A cold front extended south from the low into northwest Iowa.  The airmass became very unstable by the mid afternoon hours.  MUCAPE rose to between 4000 and 5000 J/kg.  Lifted indices fell to -8 to -11 C.  There was a considerable amount of both DCAPE at 1000-1500 J/kg and cape in the -10 to-30 C. layer of the atmoshpere, between 400 and 600 J/kg.  The freezing level was around 13,200 feet.  The environment was quite sheared with effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range.  LCL values were between 1000 and 1500 meters.  The airmass was initially capped.  During the late afternoon hours, a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over north central into northeast Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly.  Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.  It was located south of the main tornado and was on the ground for a little over a mile in Grundy County.  Initial reports indicated 9 fatalities with 7 in Parkersburg (pop 1889) and 2 in New Hartford (pop 637).  There were at least 50 injuries, with 4 of those in critical condition.  Two of the fatalities occurred a few days after the tornado from injuries sustained in the tornado.  The last fatality occurred on 7 Nov.  A 61 year old female sustained injuries in the stairwell of her home when a 2 x 4 was thrown through her right side lung.  She was hospitalized and died several months later of complications.  Significant structural damage occurred across the southern end of Parkersburg and along a path to just north of New Hartford.  Numerous structures completely destroyed from Parkersburg to near New Hartford.  The tornado continued eastward to just north of the Waterloo and Cedar Falls area.  Significant damage also occurred north of Dunkerton where the tornado increased to its greatest path width. This storm also produced substantial straight line wind damage along the southern periphery of the storm just south of the tornado track.  News accounts indicated that a receipt from Parkersburg was found around 1915 CST 3 miles north of Prairie du Chien, WI, 109 miles to the northeast.  Receipits were also found in Clayton County at Elkader, and full scrapbook pages and photos were found in far northeast Bremer County at Sumner.  Preliminary estimates that straight line winds of 90 to 100 MPH occurred with this storm. At 1637 CST, the Waterloo Airport  recorded a 93 MPH wind gust. Survey results suggest that straight line wind damage was the cause of the severe damage at the recreational vehicle dealership north of Cedar Falls.  At least 627 homes were damaged, including 288 homes destroyed in Parkersburg, 88 in New Hartford, 15 in Hazelton and another 50 in Black Hawk County. In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.  The last F4 tornado to hit Iowa was in Union, Madison, and Dallas Counties with a 56 mile path length on 8 April 1999.  There was one other smaller tornado during the evening.  A tornado touched down in Clarke County and was on the ground for a short time southeast of Osceola.  After the initial thunderstorm area developed over north central and northeast Iowa, a large complex developed over southeast Nebraska. The two areas of storms filled in to form a squall line by the mid evening hours.  The complex over Nebraska then pushed east and northeast along the squall line.  A considerable amount of severe weather was generated during the evening as this occurred.  Along the squall line, high winds and hail were common with the dominant mode of severe weather being hail of up to golf ball in size.  As the MCS out of Nebraska advanced east, a tail extending south from the centroid took on a bow echo configuration and raced east across Iowa at 65 MPH.  Very high winds occurred with this feature with numerous locations reporting winds of 65 to 85 MPH.  Some of the higher winds included an 85 MPH wind gust in the Winterset area and numerous reports of 75 to 85 MPH winds from Madison, Dallas, Warren and Polk Counties.  Lightning struck a house in Ankeny.  The house was set on fire by the strike.","A relatively brief touchdown in fields, resulting in no damage.",CSV

It took shape as a tropical depression on the morning of August 25th just southeast of Haiti, and rapidly strengthened to hurricane status by the morning of August 26th. After inflicting serious damage on portions of Haiti, Jamaica, and Cuba, Gustav entered into the southeastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico and took aim at the Gulf Coast of the United States. Although Gustav attained Category 4 status earlier in its life, Gustav eventually made landfall as a strong Category 2 system at Cocodrie, Louisiana, on September 1st, containing maximum sustained winds around 110 mph. Gustav slowed down and weakened as it continued on its northwest track across southern Louisiana where major damage was inflicted. The pace of the system continued to slow dramatically over the next few days as it turned gradually to the right around a large ridge of high pressure over the Southeast. The remnants of Gustav finally began moving rapidly away from the Lower Mississippi Valley on the 4th as an incoming disturbance deflected it to the northeast. Gustav was responsible for multiple hazardous weather elements across the service area such as tropical storm force winds, tornadoes, flash flooding, and areal flooding from extensive rains.||As the center of Gustav crossed much of southern Louisiana, tropical storm force winds extended into southern Mississippi and portions of east central Louisiana. Sustained winds were between 35 and 45 mph with higher gusts between 70 and 100 mph occurred. Tree and power line damage was extensive across these areas which resulted in widespread power outages, some of which lasted for 3 to 5 days.||As Gustav slowed across central Louisiana, the outer rainbands continued to rotate across much of southern and central Mississippi. This kept those portions of Mississippi in the region which was favorable for tornadoes. Over 3 days, 26 tornadoes were confirmed, all of which were in the EF0 to EF1 range.||As Gustav slowed on September 2nd, flash flooding became a major issue which lasted into the 3rd as the storm slowly lifted to the north and northeast.

Total rainfall across this area was between 4 and 7 inches. The heaviest rains fell across areas near and west of the Mississippi River.

Two events impacted the region in a span of 3 days which produced several tornadoes, large hail and wind damage across the area. ||On January 10th a vigorous storm system developed over the southern portions of the Midwest and moved northeast towards the Ohio valley. A strong cold front swept across the area during the late morning into the afternoon hours and strong to severe thunderstorms developed out ahead of it. All of the ingredients for tornadic development came into place as warm Gulf moisture pushed northward into the area out ahead of the front. The thunderstorms developed in eastern Louisiana and quickly moved across central Mississippi during the late morning and afternoon hours. As the storms progressed eastward, good instability combined with very strong wind shear for supercell development east of the Mississippi River, with the storms reaching maximum intensity along and east of the interstate 55 corridor.||By far, the most damage was produced by a single supercell thunderstorm that moved from north of Vicksburg through north central and northeast Mississippi during the late morning and early afternoon hours. This single storm produced three strong tornadoes, all of which were rated as EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita tornado damage scale. The most significant damage occurred in Caledonia in Lowndes County, where a school gymnasium was destroyed along with a number of school buses and vehicles in the area.||A second supercell that organized near the Mississippi River in southwest Mississippi before midday tracked from Claiborne County, through the northern Jackson Metropolitan Area, and finally into Noxubee county in northeast Mississippi by mid afternoon. This storm was responsible for 5 different tornado touchdowns along its path, as well as many reports of high winds and hail.||The rest of the area saw a broken line of storms and other supercells ahead of the line. A mix of damaging winds and hail were reported through the rest of the afternoon before the system exited the area.","The tornado started by damaging a home and shed along with some tree and power pole damage. Next, a shed was damaged and a combine harvester that was in the shed was thrown into some trees. After moving through a wooded area, the tornado moved into a neighborhood with new, well-built homes. Around 8 homes were damaged in this neighborhood, with around 5 of them being severely damaged. Roofs were ripped off, walls were collapsed, and a few were even moved off their foundations. The tornado moved through another wooded area and emerged into the Caledonia school complex. It was here that the tornado reached its maximum intensity.  The press box and concession stand of the football stadium were destroyed, several medal power poles were bent over, and several trees were knocked down. Numerous vehicles were moved along the ground up to 100 yards, some were flipped over, some had multiple dents from gravel in the parking lot, and numerous windows were broken out. Five school buses were damaged, two of which were flipped over, and one of which was lifted up and ripped apart with the chassis landing in one of the buildings and the frame landing on top of a building. The school gymnasium and a Vocational Tech Building were nearly destroyed with several vehicles including the bus landing inside it. The tornado then left the school complex and moved across the south side of Caledonia.  Around 6 homes experienced significant damage here, mainly to the roofs.  A church was completely destroyed when the roof was lifted up and collapsed on the building. Another church nearby had minor roof damage.  The tornado entered another wooded area causing damage to trees and then emerged along Caledonia-Vernon Road. The tornado moved along the road for several miles. Along this part of the path, numerous single family homes were severely damaged.  The roofs were ripped off and the walls were collapsed on several homes.  Numerous hard wood trees were snapped, several of which fell on cars and homes.   A horse stable was completely destroyed and a high tension medal truss tower was snapped.  Further along the road, several mobile homes were completely destroyed.  One in particular had the body of the trailer blown downwind and the frame was dragged back along the ground in the opposite direction for around 25 yards.  Several cars were moved for a distance around 50 yards at this location as well. The tornado then entered another wooded area causing some tree damage and then weakened before crossing the state line into Lamar County, Alabama. The total path length in Lowndes County was 8.7 miles with an EF3 Enhanced Fujita Scale rating. The total path length for the entire tornado, including each county, was 13.2 miles.||The school complex was occupied by over 2100 students and faculty at the time of the tornado. Yet, the Tornado Warning lead time of 41 minutes allowed the school to place students at the best possible locations. No injuries or fatalities occurred at the school. Also, a day care center with 15 children and faculty was severely damaged, but all 11 had taken cover in an underground storm shelter, so there were no injuries at that location either.

Two events impacted the region in a span of 3 days which produced several tornadoes, large hail and wind damage across the area. ||On January 10th a vigorous storm system developed over the southern portions of the Midwest and moved northeast towards the Ohio valley. A strong cold front swept across the area during the late morning into the afternoon hours and strong to severe thunderstorms developed out ahead of it. All of the ingredients for tornadic development came into place as warm Gulf moisture pushed northward into the area out ahead of the front. The thunderstorms developed in eastern Louisiana and quickly moved across central Mississippi during the late morning and afternoon hours. As the storms progressed eastward, good instability combined with very strong wind shear for supercell development east of the Mississippi River, with the storms reaching maximum intensity along and east of the interstate 55 corridor.||By far, the most damage was produced by a single supercell thunderstorm that moved from north of Vicksburg through north central and northeast Mississippi during the late morning and early afternoon hours. This single storm produced three strong tornadoes, all of which were rated as EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita tornado damage scale. The most significant damage occurred in Caledonia in Lowndes County, where a school gymnasium was destroyed along with a number of school buses and vehicles in the area.||A second supercell that organized near the Mississippi River in southwest Mississippi before midday tracked from Claiborne County, through the northern Jackson Metropolitan Area, and finally into Noxubee county in northeast Mississippi by mid afternoon. This storm was responsible for 5 different tornado touchdowns along its path, as well as many reports of high winds and hail.||The rest of the area saw a broken line of storms and other supercells ahead of the line. A mix of damaging winds and hail were reported through the rest of the afternoon before the system exited the area.","The tornado started, just west of Ethel, with a path of tree damage which intensified shortly after the beginning point. In some areas nearly every tree was snapped off or uprooted. The tornado reached its widest point as it crossed the Natchez Trace Parkway, where dozens of trees were snapped and uprooted. The tornado caused significant structural damage to several buildings just to the southwest of McCool. One cinder block constructed building sustained nearly total destruction from a combination of a very large hardwood tree falling on it, along with other wind damage. A room addition to the back of a frame home was removed. After the tornado passed McCool, it narrowed and weakened somewhat, with tree damage continuing to occur. The tornado then intensified again as it entered Choctaw County and passed south of the town of Weir. Here a dairy complex was heavily damaged. A well-constructed milking parlor was totally destroyed with all exterior walls collapsed or destroyed. A large 9000 pound trailer was picked up and flipped onto the top of a farm building. Several large wood and metal livestock buildings were totally destroyed. A grain silo was also destroyed. Nearly 300 head of cattle were injured with 10 fatal. After the tornado passed this point, it did not encounter any additional structures, but a path of tree damage continued for several miles before the tornado dissipated near Choctaw Lake.

A strong cold front in advance of this system was moving across Mississippi into Alabama during the evening of the 17th.  A wedge cold front was located across north and central Georgia. Very warm, unstable air was present across southern Alabama and southern Georgia, south of the wedge front.  While only marginal instability was present, very strong shear was noted with a 60-70 knot low-level jet evident across Alabama and western and central Georgia.  These systems combined to bring a strong squall line of thunderstorms to west and north Georgia during the mid and late afternoon hours.  Most of the damage associated with this line of thunderstorms was straight-line wind damage.  However, an isolated embedded EF1 tornado within a quasi-linear convective system did occur in west central Georgia in Carroll county.  Meanwhile, along the southern end of the convective line, a long-lived supercell tracked from southern Alabama into southwest Georgia, south of Columbus, and continued on a near 100-mile track across west central and central Georgia from just south of Fort Benning to just northeast of Macon.  Multiple tornadoes, ranging in strength from EF0 to EF1 were reported within broken segments along the track of this supercell, resulting in considerable damage to trees, power lines, and property.  Several injuries were reported during the stronger portion of the tornadic supercell in Taylor and Crawford counties, southwest of Macon.","A storm survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia in cooperation with the Georgia State Patrol confirmed that the same supercell thunderstorm that spawned tornadoes across southern Alabama and into Stewart, Chattahoochee, Marion, Taylor, and Crawford counties, spawned yet another EF0 tornado in extreme western Jones county near the Bibb county line, just east of Arkwright.  The tornado path length was determined to be approximately three miles long with a maximum damage path width of 100 yards.  Maximum winds were estimated at 90 mph.

The last time a tornado occurred in January in Wisconsin was on the 24th in 1967 in Green and Rock Counties (25-mile track).  On January 7th, a low pressure moved northeast through western Wisconsin, allowing a warm front to push through southern Wisconsin.  Temperatures rose into the lower to mid 60s over southeast Wisconsin with surface dewpoints peaking in the mid to upper 50s, resulting in moderate amounts of instablity.  Strong, veering winds from the surface to the jet stream level generated sufficient wind shear that supported rotating updrafts in scattered supercell thunderstorms over southeast Wisconsin.  A supercell thunderstorm, that had spun up a tornado in northeastern Illinois previously, then crossed the state line into south-central Walworth County (southeast of the city of Walworth) where it intesified and eventually spun up a tornado near Pell Lake that traveled into western Kenosha County.  Another supercell spun up a tornado over the northern reaches of the city of Kensoha.

An upper-level low pressure system dropped south along the California coast, kicking a low pressure system inland. This weather system became nearly stationary southwest of Point Conception on the 26th. This low brought strong downslope winds through the Tejon Pass into the south end of the San Joaquin Valley. Southeast winds with sustained speeds of 68 mph were measured at the base of the Grapevine for about 2 hours late in the evening of January 26th, with a gust to 65 mph reported as far north as Bakersfield. The gust was on the east side of the city; the highest gust measured at Meadows Field Airport was 49 mph.||This storm also had enough cold air, initially, to produce heavy snowfall in the Sierra Nevada. Totals ranged generally between 12 to 30 inches in the higher terrain during the first two days of this storm event, January 26-27.||Subtropical moisture spinning around the low brought heavy rain to the Tehachapi Mountains west of the Grapevine. Because of the subtropical nature of the moisture, the snow levels were high and warm rain fell on the nearly 2 feet of snow at Frazier Park from the previous storm. As the ground saturated, mud slides developed on the mountain slopes, closing Frazier Mountain Park Road and triggering the issuance of a Flash Flood Warning for mud and debris flows. Rainwater runoff from the Tejon Pass flowed into the south end of the San Joaquin Valley, causing flooding on parts of Copus and David Roads as well.||In the Kern County desert, heavy rain falling on the El Paso Mountains resulted in flooding of the Garlock and Red Rock Roads along the south flanks of the mountains in Kern County.||The warm, unstable airmass also triggered outbreaks of severe thunderstorms over portions of the San Joaquin Valley on the 27th, especially in Tulare and Fresno Counties. A severe thunderstorm developed south of Visalia shortly after noon, and spawned a weak tornado that knocked down trees and severely damaged a trailer park. The tornado, rated EF-0 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale with peak winds of 70 mph, was the first tornado to hit the San Joaquin Valley since March 28, 2006, when an EF-0 tornado touched down 1 mile southeast of the city of Merced. The last tornado to hit Tulare County had been an F-0 that touched down 5 miles southeast of Dinuba on October 20, 2004.||A strong thunderstorm formed shortly after 4 PM on the 27th, again just south of Visalia, and then passed over the east side of the city. This storm was weaker than the earlier thunderstorm, but did produce one-quarter inch hail and damaging wind gusts. ||The large Pacific storm continued through the 28th. Fresno recorded another third of an inch of rain that day, and winds gusted to 33 mph at Fresno-Yosemite International Airport. Very little rain fell over the south end of the Valley, with Bakersfield getting a total of only 0.01 inch of rain for the three-day event, although winds did gust to 37 mph at Meadows Field on the 28th. A weak upper-level low pressure trough, trailing the storm, moved through central California on the 29th, keeping unsettled weather over the region right through the end of the month.","Official NWS survey in the City of Visalia indicated an EF0 (Enhanced Fujita Scale: maximum estimated wind speeds 60 to 70 mph) tornado touched down and caused minor damage on the west side of Visalia just after noon on January 27, 2008. The damage assessment indicated that this weak tornado was associated with a small severe thunderstorm that developed just southwest of Visalia and moved northeast across the west portion of the city and to the northeast of the city between about noon and 1230 pm on january 27, 2008. The damage survey indicated the tornado touched down near a mobile home park along Akers Street on the west side of the city. Damage occurred across the park with several medium to large sized shallow rooted trees uprooted, fences downed, branches removed, and shingles and carports damaged. Several medium sized trees were downed onto homes or garages causing moderate damage to those homes. The tops of several trees were damaged and some fences were blown in different directions, suggesting this event was caused by a weak tornado, in addition to the discovery of a small damage path. National Weather Service doppler radar also indicated rotation within the lowest levels of the storm at the time of the event. Eyewitness accounts of a loud roaring noise, funnel clouds, and large debris/dust clouds also occurred near the mobile home park and contributed to the storm survey. The tornado likely continued for up to two miles to the northeast as additional similar damage was discovered along Goshen Avenue near the Visalia Municipal Golf Course. Minor damage also occurred in other parts of Visalia with a few utility poles and trees and branches downed, likely from straight-line wind damage due to the outflow of the severe thunderstorm.",CSV

Thunderstorms erupted to the southwest of Iowa in central Kansas, along the dry line there.  The storms raced northeast into Iowa by sunset.  In spite of the dynamics that were in place, the amount of severe weather was relatively limited.  Hail was limited by the high freezing level and lack of supercellular development.  Several of the storms produced small hail and a few produced high winds.  There were several reports of brief tornado touchdowns, but little in the way of damage was reported for the most part.  The first tornado touched down in Cass County and was only on the ground briefly.  Another tornado touched down in Union County.  The tornado took the roof off of an outbuilding and knocked down some power lines.  The strongest tornado was on the ground for over 18 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The tornado track was over open country for the most part and damaged outbuildings and one house.  Three other tornadoes touched down in Jasper County, causing some moderate damage.  The most significant feature with this event was the flash flooding.  Soil conditions across the state were very saturated.  Any significant rainfall resulted in flash flooding.  A narrow band of heavier rainfall stretched from south central into central Iowa.  Flash flooding occurred in the Des Moines metro area as the airport recorded 4.15 inches of rainfall for the day, with about 3 inches falling in two hours.  Reports of severe street flooding were received with numerous reports of manhole covers being blown off.  During the event, high winds occurred over the far northwest part of the CWA as the surface low intensified rapidly and the gradient tightened.  A window was blown out in Pocahontas County, with tree and power line damage done in Emmet County.

The surface low formed over the southern Rockies the previous night and moved into Kansas during the day, then moved into southwest Iowa  during the evening of the 10th.  The upper level low pressure became nearly stacked by the morning of the 11th.  For the most part, Iowa remained on the cold side of the system through the day.  During the late afternoon, as the low lifted northeast, a warm front extending east out of the low pushed north into the state.  South of the front, temperatures were in the 60s to low 70s with dew point temperatures in the upper 50s to low 60s.  The atmosphere became unstable with CAPE in the 500 to 1000 J/kg range by evening across southern Iowa.  A strong low level jet was in place with wind speeds around 60 kts.  With the strong winds, both in the low levels and aloft, the effective shear was quite high in the 40 to 55 kt range.  The LCL was quite low with the rainfall that continued through the day and was around 500 meters during the event.  A fair share of the CAPE was in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere with 300 J/kg available.  This was a classic low top convection case with the upper low and dry line approaching from the southwest.  The freezing level was very low across the CWA, sloping from around 6000 feet in the Omaha, NE area, to 9700 feet in the Davenport, IA area.  Lifted indices were around +4, however on the warm side of the warm front they were in the -2 to -4 C. range.  The warm front surged north rapidly into Iowa during the evening, pushing from the Iowa-Missouri border into central Iowa in about 4 hours.  Thunderstorms initially formed in an arc from northeast Kansas into western Missouri.  The storms lifted north-northeast at 50 to 60 MPH.  Rotation was noted in nearly all of the storms with tornadoes produced by some.  One of the stronger storms was a cyclic tornado producer and moved out of northern Missouri into Wayne and Appanoose Counties.  It continued northeast across Monroe, into Mahaska, and then Poweshiek Counties.  Two small tornadoes touched down in Wayne County.  They were only on the ground briefly and caused no damage as they were in open country.  Wind speeds on these tornadoes were estimated at 75 MPH.  A tornado touched down in Appanoose County near Seymour and produced winds of 90 to 100 mph.  Damage from the tornado started about 1 mile south of the intersection of highway J46 and 105th Avenue in far western Appanoose County.  The tornado moved rapidly northeast producing primarily tree damage across rural countryside.  The tornado hit a residence on the southern side of Highway J46, producing EF1 damage to the house and various outbuildings. In addition, a large utility pole was pulled 4 feet south before listing severely to the north.  The tornado and debris continue for close to another mile before ending. The storm moved north into the Iconium area.  It was observed on southern shore of Rathbun Reservoir before traversing the lake and entering into the Antler Acres Trailer park subdivision.  The tornado produced much roof and soffit damage, as well as window damage to many of the homes.    However, one mobile home was lifted and shifted several feet before tie downs held it in place.  The worst damage was to a mobile home which was flipped on its side after the tie downs were ripped out of the ground.  An additional outbuilding about one quarter of a mile to the northeast was badly damaged as well.  The tornado moved nearly to the Monroe County border before lifting.  It set down again in Mahaska County and moved northeast to the southwest of Oskaloosa.  Scattered damage occurred along its path with damage done to fuel pumps at a gas station in the Oskaloosa area as the parent storm passed.  There was also considerable wind damage in the area caused by the RFD.  The same storm moved into Poweshiek County.  The tornado redeveloped just northeast of Barnes City and moved northeast.  Several power lines were downed along with structural and shingle damage to houses. In addition, storm spotters reported some grain bin damage, and road signs were pulled out of the ground.  One mobile home was ripped from its foundation in the 1900 block of Highway 85.  Another brief touchdown occurred a short time later in Poweshiek County.  In addition to the tornadic storms, several of the storms produced high winds and hail.  The hail was generally no larger than an inch in diameter, with most of it around nickel size.  The largest hail was west of Centerville in Appanoose County where one inch diameter hail fell.  There were several reports of high winds, though much of the damage was relatively minor.  High winds in Oskaloosa caused some roof damage and took down power poles.  Damage was also reported to fuel pumps in Oskaloosa.  In Poweshiek County, two barns were blown down and portions of a roof were peeled off at a farmstead east of Brooklyn.  In addition, siding was torn off of the house and windows were blown out.

South of the front, temperatures were in the 60s to low 70s with dew point temperatures in the upper 50s to low 60s.  The atmosphere became unstable with CAPE in the 500 to 1000 J/kg range by evening across southern Iowa.  A strong low level jet was in place with wind speeds around 60 kts.  With the strong winds, both in the low levels and aloft, the effective shear was quite high in the 40 to 55 kt range.  The LCL was quite low with the rainfall that continued through the day and was around 500 meters during the event.  A fair share of the CAPE was in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere with 300 J/kg available.  This was a classic low top convection case with the upper low and dry line approaching from the southwest.  The freezing level was very low across the CWA, sloping from around 6000 feet in the Omaha, NE area, to 9700 feet in the Davenport, IA area.  Lifted indices were around +4, however on the warm side of the warm front they were in the -2 to -4 C. range.  The warm front surged north rapidly into Iowa during the evening, pushing from the Iowa-Missouri border into central Iowa in about 4 hours.  Thunderstorms initially formed in an arc from northeast Kansas into western Missouri.  The storms lifted north-northeast at 50 to 60 MPH.  Rotation was noted in nearly all of the storms with tornadoes produced by some.  One of the stronger storms was a cyclic tornado producer and moved out of northern Missouri into Wayne and Appanoose Counties.  It continued northeast across Monroe, into Mahaska, and then Poweshiek Counties.  Two small tornadoes touched down in Wayne County.  They were only on the ground briefly and caused no damage as they were in open country.  Wind speeds on these tornadoes were estimated at 75 MPH.  A tornado touched down in Appanoose County near Seymour and produced winds of 90 to 100 mph.  Damage from the tornado started about 1 mile south of the intersection of highway J46 and 105th Avenue in far western Appanoose County.  The tornado moved rapidly northeast producing primarily tree damage across rural countryside.  The tornado hit a residence on the southern side of Highway J46, producing EF1 damage to the house and various outbuildings. In addition, a large utility pole was pulled 4 feet south before listing severely to the north.  The tornado and debris continue for close to another mile before ending. The storm moved north into the Iconium area.  It was observed on southern shore of Rathbun Reservoir before traversing the lake and entering into the Antler Acres Trailer park subdivision.  The tornado produced much roof and soffit damage, as well as window damage to many of the homes.    However, one mobile home was lifted and shifted several feet before tie downs held it in place.  The worst damage was to a mobile home which was flipped on its side after the tie downs were ripped out of the ground.  An additional outbuilding about one quarter of a mile to the northeast was badly damaged as well.  The tornado moved nearly to the Monroe County border before lifting.  It set down again in Mahaska County and moved northeast to the southwest of Oskaloosa.  Scattered damage occurred along its path with damage done to fuel pumps at a gas station in the Oskaloosa area as the parent storm passed.  There was also considerable wind damage in the area caused by the RFD.  The same storm moved into Poweshiek County.  The tornado redeveloped just northeast of Barnes City and moved northeast.  Several power lines were downed along with structural and shingle damage to houses. In addition, storm spotters reported some grain bin damage, and road signs were pulled out of the ground.  One mobile home was ripped from its foundation in the 1900 block of Highway 85.  Another brief touchdown occurred a short time later in Poweshiek County.  In addition to the tornadic storms, several of the storms produced high winds and hail.  The hail was generally no larger than an inch in diameter, with most of it around nickel size.  The largest hail was west of Centerville in Appanoose County where one inch diameter hail fell.  There were several reports of high winds, though much of the damage was relatively minor.  High winds in Oskaloosa caused some roof damage and took down power poles.  Damage was also reported to fuel pumps in Oskaloosa.  In Poweshiek County, two barns were blown down and portions of a roof were peeled off at a farmstead east of Brooklyn.  In addition, siding was torn off of the house and windows were blown out.  These were some of the more substantial reports.  Late in the event, additional thunderstorms formed over northern Missouri.

The storm moved north into the Iconium area.  It was observed on southern shore of Rathbun Reservoir before traversing the lake and entering into the Antler Acres Trailer park subdivision.  The tornado produced much roof and soffit damage, as well as window damage to many of the homes.    However, one mobile home was lifted and shifted several feet before tie downs held it in place.  The worst damage was to a mobile home which was flipped on its side after the tie downs were ripped out of the ground.  An additional outbuilding about one quarter of a mile to the northeast was badly damaged as well.  The tornado moved nearly to the Monroe County border before lifting.  It set down again in Mahaska County and moved northeast to the southwest of Oskaloosa.  Scattered damage occurred along its path with damage done to fuel pumps at a gas station in the Oskaloosa area as the parent storm passed.  There was also considerable wind damage in the area caused by the RFD.  The same storm moved into Poweshiek County.  The tornado redeveloped just northeast of Barnes City and moved northeast.  Several power lines were downed along with structural and shingle damage to houses. In addition, storm spotters reported some grain bin damage, and road signs were pulled out of the ground.  One mobile home was ripped from its foundation in the 1900 block of Highway 85.  Another brief touchdown occurred a short time later in Poweshiek County.  In addition to the tornadic storms, several of the storms produced high winds and hail.  The hail was generally no larger than an inch in diameter, with most of it around nickel size.  The largest hail was west of Centerville in Appanoose County where one inch diameter hail fell.  There were several reports of high winds, though much of the damage was relatively minor.  High winds in Oskaloosa caused some roof damage and took down power poles.  Damage was also reported to fuel pumps in Oskaloosa.  In Poweshiek County, two barns were blown down and portions of a roof were peeled off at a farmstead east of Brooklyn.  In addition, siding was torn off of the house and windows were blown out.  These were some of the more substantial reports.  Late in the event, additional thunderstorms formed over northern Missouri.

Low pressure approached from the west, along with a cold front so that the triple point was near the western Iowa, eastern Nebraska area by late afternoon.  Thunderstorms erupted quickly during the late afternoon and evening hours in the unstable airmass.  By evening, the low level jet was in the 40 to 60 kt range, feeding moisture into the state and pushing precipitable water values to around 200% of normal, in the 1.5 to 1.8 inch range.  MUCAPE reached 3000 to 3500 J/kg over western Iowa, with lifted indices in the -6 to -10 C. range.  The freezing level was quite high, limiting the hail size somewhat with this event, at 14,300 feet.  The available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was in the 300 to 500 J/kg range.  The DCAPE was between 800 and 1000 J/kg.  The environment was highly sheared with 50 to 65 kts of shear available during the event.  The LCL was also quite low, in the 750 to 1250 meter range.  Thunderstorms erupted over western Iowa stretching into north central Iowa first.  It did not take long for the storms to become severe with hail and high winds.  Most of the hail reported was in the pea to marble size, with the larger stones in the nickel to quarter size range.  The primary mode of severe weather was high winds and several tornadoes.  The secondary, but significant threat, was heavy rainfall.  A band of 3 to 5 inches of rain fell between U.S. Highway 30 and U.S. Highway 20 during the event.  The heaviest rainfall total was in Greene County at Jefferson, with 5.90 inches.  Tornadoes began to touch down in western Iowa in Crawford County with two brief touchdowns.  One was west of Dow City, causing roof and shingle damage to a farmhouse there.  The next was east of Denison where a barn roof was removed and a trailer house was destroyed.  A tornado in Carroll County caused damage to 3 farmsteads southeast of Templeton.  A machine shed was completely destroyed and numerous other buildings sustained damage.  Trees also had substantial damage. Two tornadoes touched down in Calhoun County.  One near Farnhamville, tore the roof off of a home and downed power lines.  The second caused damage to trees, outbuildings, and power lines on four farmsteads.  Farther south, a brief touchdown was reported in Dallas County in open fields west of Minburn.  Another tornado touched down in Dallas County later on, west of Adel, and was on the ground for about 4 miles.  A more substantial tornado touched down near Murray in Clarke County with one reported on the ground for about 9 miles.  As the storms moved east, another tornado was on the ground for over 10 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The most significant tornado occurred in Marion and Mahaska Counties where an EF2 tornado was on the ground for about 18 miles.  Several homes were damaged along its path, two mobile homes were destroyed, and considerable damage was done to trees in the area.  Up to 10 people were injured with this tornado, mainly in Attica.  The official damage count from this tornado included 5 homes destroyed, 15 with major damage, and another 25 with minor damage.  Many of the storms produced high winds with several reports of winds in the 65 to 75 MPH range.  Considerable tree damage was reported and some structural damage, mainly outbuildings and shingle damage.  Two cars were blown off of the road east of Manning by the high winds.  Building debris was blown onto Highway D60 near Gowrie, causing a brief closure.  High winds in Butler County blew down a machine shed and barn southwest of Aplington, very near to where an EF5 tornado struck just days before.  Extensive damage was done to a farmstead there with some damage done to the house itself as well.  Lightning struck a man in Carroll.  The lightning bolt hit his driveway, blowing out a chunk of concrete out of the driveway and also injured the man.  He was taken to hospital, treated, and released with minor injuries.  Flooding became a significant issue after the heavy rainfall of the previous few days.  Extensive river flooding occurred across the central third of the state.

A strong cold front in advance of this system was moving across Mississippi into Alabama during the evening of the 17th.  A wedge cold front was located across north and central Georgia. Very warm, unstable air was present across southern Alabama and southern Georgia, south of the wedge front.  While only marginal instability was present, very strong shear was noted with a 60-70 knot low-level jet evident across Alabama and western and central Georgia.  These systems combined to bring a strong squall line of thunderstorms to west and north Georgia during the mid and late afternoon hours.  Most of the damage associated with this line of thunderstorms was straight-line wind damage.  However, an isolated embedded EF1 tornado within a quasi-linear convective system did occur in west central Georgia in Carroll county.  Meanwhile, along the southern end of the convective line, a long-lived supercell tracked from southern Alabama into southwest Georgia, south of Columbus, and continued on a near 100-mile track across west central and central Georgia from just south of Fort Benning to just northeast of Macon.  Multiple tornadoes, ranging in strength from EF0 to EF1 were reported within broken segments along the track of this supercell, resulting in considerable damage to trees, power lines, and property.  Several injuries were reported during the stronger portion of the tornadic supercell in Taylor and Crawford counties, southwest of Macon.","An aerial and ground survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia concluded that the EF0 tornado that originated in Stewart county and then tracked through Chattahoochee county, continued into Marion county.

Low pressure approached from the west, along with a cold front so that the triple point was near the western Iowa, eastern Nebraska area by late afternoon.  Thunderstorms erupted quickly during the late afternoon and evening hours in the unstable airmass.  By evening, the low level jet was in the 40 to 60 kt range, feeding moisture into the state and pushing precipitable water values to around 200% of normal, in the 1.5 to 1.8 inch range.  MUCAPE reached 3000 to 3500 J/kg over western Iowa, with lifted indices in the -6 to -10 C. range.  The freezing level was quite high, limiting the hail size somewhat with this event, at 14,300 feet.  The available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was in the 300 to 500 J/kg range.  The DCAPE was between 800 and 1000 J/kg.  The environment was highly sheared with 50 to 65 kts of shear available during the event.  The LCL was also quite low, in the 750 to 1250 meter range.  Thunderstorms erupted over western Iowa stretching into north central Iowa first.  It did not take long for the storms to become severe with hail and high winds.  Most of the hail reported was in the pea to marble size, with the larger stones in the nickel to quarter size range.  The primary mode of severe weather was high winds and several tornadoes.  The secondary, but significant threat, was heavy rainfall.  A band of 3 to 5 inches of rain fell between U.S. Highway 30 and U.S. Highway 20 during the event.  The heaviest rainfall total was in Greene County at Jefferson, with 5.90 inches.  Tornadoes began to touch down in western Iowa in Crawford County with two brief touchdowns.  One was west of Dow City, causing roof and shingle damage to a farmhouse there.  The next was east of Denison where a barn roof was removed and a trailer house was destroyed.  A tornado in Carroll County caused damage to 3 farmsteads southeast of Templeton.  A machine shed was completely destroyed and numerous other buildings sustained damage.  Trees also had substantial damage. Two tornadoes touched down in Calhoun County.  One near Farnhamville, tore the roof off of a home and downed power lines.  The second caused damage to trees, outbuildings, and power lines on four farmsteads.  Farther south, a brief touchdown was reported in Dallas County in open fields west of Minburn.  Another tornado touched down in Dallas County later on, west of Adel, and was on the ground for about 4 miles.  A more substantial tornado touched down near Murray in Clarke County with one reported on the ground for about 9 miles.

The heaviest rainfall total was in Greene County at Jefferson, with 5.90 inches.  Tornadoes began to touch down in western Iowa in Crawford County with two brief touchdowns.  One was west of Dow City, causing roof and shingle damage to a farmhouse there.  The next was east of Denison where a barn roof was removed and a trailer house was destroyed.  A tornado in Carroll County caused damage to 3 farmsteads southeast of Templeton.  A machine shed was completely destroyed and numerous other buildings sustained damage.  Trees also had substantial damage. Two tornadoes touched down in Calhoun County.  One near Farnhamville, tore the roof off of a home and downed power lines.  The second caused damage to trees, outbuildings, and power lines on four farmsteads.  Farther south, a brief touchdown was reported in Dallas County in open fields west of Minburn.  Another tornado touched down in Dallas County later on, west of Adel, and was on the ground for about 4 miles.  A more substantial tornado touched down near Murray in Clarke County with one reported on the ground for about 9 miles.  As the storms moved east, another tornado was on the ground for over 10 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The most significant tornado occurred in Marion and Mahaska Counties where an EF2 tornado was on the ground for about 18 miles.  Several homes were damaged along its path, two mobile homes were destroyed, and considerable damage was done to trees in the area.  Up to 10 people were injured with this tornado, mainly in Attica.  The official damage count from this tornado included 5 homes destroyed, 15 with major damage, and another 25 with minor damage.  Many of the storms produced high winds with several reports of winds in the 65 to 75 MPH range.  Considerable tree damage was reported and some structural damage, mainly outbuildings and shingle damage.  Two cars were blown off of the road east of Manning by the high winds.  Building debris was blown onto Highway D60 near Gowrie, causing a brief closure.  High winds in Butler County blew down a machine shed and barn southwest of Aplington, very near to where an EF5 tornado struck just days before.  Extensive damage was done to a farmstead there with some damage done to the house itself as well.  Lightning struck a man in Carroll.  The lightning bolt hit his driveway, blowing out a chunk of concrete out of the driveway and also injured the man.  He was taken to hospital, treated, and released with minor injuries.  Flooding became a significant issue after the heavy rainfall of the previous few days.  Extensive river flooding occurred across the central third of the state.  Record crests were recorded on the Iowa River at Marshalltown.","A tornado caused damage to trees, farm buildings, and power lines.  The tornado moved into the county from Warren County.",CSV

With the exception of one hail report of 3 inch diameter hail report in north central Iowa, hail size was somewhat limited by the freezing level of 15500 to 16500 feet.  A very strong transport of moisture took place on a 50 to 75 kt 850 mb jet.  Precipitable water values soared to 1.6 to 1.9 inches by evening.  During the initial phase of the severe event, high winds and hail were reported along the line of thunderstorms that formed from northern into west central Iowa.  There were four reports of tornadoes in Worth, Winnebago and Cerro Gordo Counties during the afternoon hours of the 7th.  This was with the initial round of storms.  One of the tornadoes in Winnebago County destroyed a hog confinement building containing 3500 hogs.  Several of them were killed and the remaining hogs needed to be taken to slaughter.  The event transitioned into a flooding event overnight, then tornadoes began again during the afternoon of the 8th.  A tornado touched down in Taylor County.  Windows were blown out of houses there and several trees were twisted and blown down around the house.  A pole shed was completely destroyed south of Ferguson in Marshall County.  A stronger tornado was on the ground north to northeast of Ottumwa.  A home lost a roof, with a wall of one room partially collapsed by the tornado.  Several trees were also downed around the home.  The event transitioned into a major Flood/Flash Flood event during the evening and early morning hours with many locations reporting 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and spotty amounts of around 5 inches in just a few hours time.  The line moved very little for a period of several hours.  During the predawn hours, the line became broad and weakened to generally below severe limits.  A new round of thunderstorms from Nebraska, which was the southwest part of the extensive line, moved into  west central and southwest Iowa.  The storm generally remained below severe levels for the most part, but they did produce very heavy rains.    Another line of thunderstorms formed/re-intensified along the frontal boundary by the early afternoon hours.  Initially, the storms produced strong winds and some small hail.  As they moved southeast, several reports of high winds to near 70 MPH and a few reports of tornadoes were received.  The most significant weather feature with this event was the heavy rainfall.  The antecedent soil conditions in Iowa were extremely wet, such that flash flooding was caused by rainfall of an inch or more in an hour, even in rural areas.  Heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches occurred in a broad swath extending from west central into north central, and parts of central and northeast Iowa.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding.  Eventually, the rain lead to major to record flooding along many of the rivers in the state.  At one point or another, about 40 of the DMX 51 counties in the CWA were under flash flood warning.  The situation was very serious over the north central and northeast counties.  A levy was breached in the Mason City area as the Winnebago River rose to 3 feet over the record stage.  The city was inundated by water.  The water treatment plant was under water and non operational, all power was lost to the power grid in the city.  The river cut a new channel and changed course into the downtown area.  In the New Hartford area, a dam broke on Beaver Creek, resulting in the water level rising 2 feet above the all-time record level.  High water along the mainstem Cedar River also caused communities to lose water.  Nashua lost water as the water plant became flooded.  Flooding along the Shell Rock River resulted in water supply loss in the town of Rockford.  There was one death that resulted from the flooding.  A 33 year old man died as he drove into flood waters in Interstate 35 at mile post 141 in Hamilton County.  A second death occurred in Wright County as a 50 year old male farmer near Galt was sucked into a culvert by flood waters as he checked the field tiles in his farm field.",Rain wrapped tornado.

Two supercell thunderstorms developed along the dryline, then moved east into the Big Country where the first report of a brief tornado touched down south of the town of Rotan. These storms continued to move east towards the U.S. Highway 277 corridor where one of the supercells rapidly intensified just west of Anson. Straight line winds associated with a powerful rear flank downdraft caused widespread damage across Anson and surrounding rural areas. Many power poles were snapped just north of Anson on U.S. Highway 277. Many trees were either uprooted or had their branches snapped by the severe thunderstorm wind gusts. High winds caused roof damage, destroyed outbuildings, and overturned tractor trailers. Winds were estimated at 70 to 90 mph. An EF0 tornado with winds estimated at 65 to 85 mph caused damage to power poles 5 miles north of Anson and caused some roof damage to a home 5 miles west-southwest of Avoca. This severe thunderstorm weakened slightly as it moved east before strengthening once again just east of Albany where more wind damage was reported as well as another report of a tornado by storm chasers. Widespread hail damaged crops, homes, and automobiles, with sizes ranging from quarter to baseball size.

Another line of thunderstorms formed/re-intensified along the frontal boundary by the early afternoon hours.  Initially, the storms produced strong winds and some small hail.  As they moved southeast, several reports of high winds to near 70 MPH and a few reports of tornadoes were received.  The most significant weather feature with this event was the heavy rainfall.  The antecedent soil conditions in Iowa were extremely wet, such that flash flooding was caused by rainfall of an inch or more in an hour, even in rural areas.  Heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches occurred in a broad swath extending from west central into north central, and parts of central and northeast Iowa.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding.  Eventually, the rain lead to major to record flooding along many of the rivers in the state.  At one point or another, about 40 of the DMX 51 counties in the CWA were under flash flood warning.  The situation was very serious over the north central and northeast counties.  A levy was breached in the Mason City area as the Winnebago River rose to 3 feet over the record stage.  The city was inundated by water.  The water treatment plant was under water and non operational, all power was lost to the power grid in the city.  The river cut a new channel and changed course into the downtown area.  In the New Hartford area, a dam broke on Beaver Creek, resulting in the water level rising 2 feet above the all-time record level.  High water along the mainstem Cedar River also caused communities to lose water.  Nashua lost water as the water plant became flooded.  Flooding along the Shell Rock River resulted in water supply loss in the town of Rockford.  There was one death that resulted from the flooding.  A 33 year old man died as he drove into flood waters in Interstate 35 at mile post 141 in Hamilton County.

A semi-stationary front extended northeast from the low, across northern Iowa during the afternoon into the evening hours.  The atmosphere became very unstable with MUCAPE in the 4500 to 5000 J/kg range by mid afternoon and lifted indices around -7 C.  The shear was quite high, between 40 and 70 kts.

With the exception of one hail report of 3 inch diameter hail report in north central Iowa, hail size was somewhat limited by the freezing level of 15500 to 16500 feet.  A very strong transport of moisture took place on a 50 to 75 kt 850 mb jet.  Precipitable water values soared to 1.6 to 1.9 inches by evening.  During the initial phase of the severe event, high winds and hail were reported along the line of thunderstorms that formed from northern into west central Iowa.  There were four reports of tornadoes in Worth, Winnebago and Cerro Gordo Counties during the afternoon hours of the 7th.  This was with the initial round of storms.  One of the tornadoes in Winnebago County destroyed a hog confinement building containing 3500 hogs.  Several of them were killed and the remaining hogs needed to be taken to slaughter.  The event transitioned into a flooding event overnight, then tornadoes began again during the afternoon of the 8th.  A tornado touched down in Taylor County.  Windows were blown out of houses there and several trees were twisted and blown down around the house.  A pole shed was completely destroyed south of Ferguson in Marshall County.  A stronger tornado was on the ground north to northeast of Ottumwa.  A home lost a roof, with a wall of one room partially collapsed by the tornado.  Several trees were also downed around the home.  The event transitioned into a major Flood/Flash Flood event during the evening and early morning hours with many locations reporting 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and spotty amounts of around 5 inches in just a few hours time.

The stationary front provided the focus for two rounds of showers and thunderstorms, one early in the morning on the 10th and another in the afternoon.  The activity tracked east-southeast with the upper flow aloft, mainly across north Georgia during the early morning and across central Georgia during the afternoon.  An isolated strong supercell also tracked across the southern part of central Georgia during the evening.  After a lull of convective activity for about four hours, intense multicell thunderstorms tracked into the area from Alabama after midnight and before dawn on the 11th.  As these thunderstorms tracked across west central and central Georgia, 15 tornadoes were identified by subsequent surveys making this the most significant tornado outbreak to affect the area since the Katrina-associated tornadoes on August 29, 2005.

The tornado was rated an EF2 at that location.  From there the tornado damaged a church on Elm Road with trees also snapped or uprooted in both areas as well.  The tornado continued east northeast causing substantial tree and outbuilding damage to 10 more farmsteads, along with some house damage.  Most of the damage occurred along Hackberry Road with the damage path around 1/4 mile wide.  As the tornado worked its way east northeast toward Johnson county...the damage gradually weakened and the path narrowed.  The tornado was estimated to have lifted a little northeast of Filley.  Emergency management estimated that the tornado and the wind damage south through east of town caused at least a million dollars worth of damage.",CSV

Three confirmed tornadoes occurred briefly in western Dewey County.  Little or no damage was reported and all three tornadoes were rated EF-0. In addition to the tornadoes, multiple reports of large hail were received over Corson and Dewey Counties, including some to the size of baseballs near the communities of McLaughlin and Isabel.  The large hail broke out many home and vehicle windows and damaged many roofs in Dewey, Corson, and Sully Counties.||Significant wind damage occurred over sections of Sully County.  There were multiple reports of wind gusts in excess of 70 mph, with the most concentrated swath of damaging winds extending from near Sutton Bay, eastward to the city of Onida, then southeast to the community of Harrold.   ||The storm survey began near Sutton Bay on Lake Oahe, where a wind gust of 92 mph was recorded. The most significant property damage was found further east near the community of Agar where multiple grain bins were either damaged or destroyed.  Nine miles west of Agar, a barn was destroyed and a large pine tree was snapped in half. Winds in this area were estimated to range from 80 to 100 mph.  Near the intersection of Highways 1804 and 175th Street, several Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) electrical transmission towers were completely collapsed. This is consistent with wind speeds ranging from 130-140 mph. In the city of Onida a bank roof was damaged and the city was without power until the next day.  Four miles north of Onida, a feed wagon was tossed nearly 40 feet. In Harrold, several railroad cars were tipped over.||Also of great significance during the event was the peak wind speed of 124 mph recorded at the Onida airport.

Copious amounts of moisture were available that allowed repeated heavy rains.  Additionally, there was sufficient vertical wind shear to allow for the generation of supercell thunderstorms with rotating updrafts that led to seven tornadoes in this part of the state of Wisconsin.  The flooding rains constituted the 2nd round/punch of heavy rains that led to more widespread and severe flash flooding and record-setting river flooding (1st punch was Jun 7-9, 2008).||The axis of heavy rains on June 12th extended from Lafayette County northeast through Dane County to eastern Green Lake County and western Fond du Lac County.  Generally 4 to 6 inches fell in this area, with 1 to 4 inches elsewhere.  The generous rains in June at Milwuakee led to a montly total of 12.27 inches.  This easily broke the record for highest June rainfall total. The previous record was 10.13 inches, set in 1917, and also makes June, 2008, the wettest month ever at Milwaukee.||The Rock River crested at all-time record high levels at the following gauage sites:  Waupun (10.07' on 6/13), Horicon (10.29' on 6/17), Watertown (7.81' on 6/13), Jefferson (15.64' on 6/18), Ft.

A low pressure wave formed on the front and lifted northeast across the state during the late afternoon.  As the front sagged south, a line of thunderstorms formed and moved east-southeast through Iowa.  The airmass became very unstable by late afternoon with CAPE in the 3000-4000 J/kg range and lifted indices in the -6 to -10 C range.  Surface dewpoints rose into the low to mid 70s ahead of the front with temperatures in the 80s.

The thunderstorms became severe quite rapidly and produced wind gusts to around 60 MPH.  Hail was limited in size by the warm and moist atmosphere.  Most of the hail was around three quarters of an inch or less, with the larger hail around an inch in diameter.  There there three tornadoes during the event.  The first touched down in Kossuth County, south of Algona, and did only minor damage with trees uprooted.  The second was in Carroll County from the Templeton area toward Coon Rapids.  This tornado caused more damage along its track.  On one farmstead, it hit the house and barn.  The barn was completely flattened, and damage was done to the house.  Power lines were also downed.  The main line of storms moved out of the state by around midnight.  During the night, as the low level jet strengthened, the front began lifting north again.

Dolly intensified rapidly to an estimated minimum pressure of 962 mb while drifting northward just east of South Padre Island, and its center made landfall between 1 and 2 PM on July 23rd along the unpopulated shoreline of Cameron and Willacy County. Dolly then eased westward across southern Willacy County through the afternoon, continued into extreme northern Hidalgo County as a tropical storm during the evening, then turned northwest and accelerated through Jim Hogg County during the early morning hours of the 24th, passing into Webb County shortly after sunrise.||The strong winds and heavy rains contributed to widespread power outages in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, where at least 236,000 customers lost power, but possibly upwards of 250,000 - primarily across the more populated regions of Cameron, Hidalgo, and Willacy County. Agricultural experts deemed a substantial loss of cotton and sorghum due to the strong winds and torrential rain. As of the end of Calendar Year 2008, estimated insured property damage (wind) based on the standard doubling of insurance estimates from the Property Claims Service of the Insurance Services Office was $1.05 billion.  Reported insured flood damage from FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program is $171 thousand; however, it is estimated that the vast majority of flood damage occurred to uninsured properties, and a rough estimate of total flood damage, which was more widespread, and includes agricultural losses, will likely push total flood-related damages to between $100 and $300 million.  ||It is conceivable that total damage from all Hurricane Dolly related hazards may have exceeded $1.5 billion.||More than 6,000 Lower Rio Grande Valley residents were housed in temporary shelters from Deep South Texas to San Antonio at the peak of the storm; 13,000 residents across the Lower Rio Grande Valley visited FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers after the storm.  As of October 3rd, FEMA had distributed $44 million in relief; $30 million to individual households, nearly $10 million to small businesses through the Small Business Administration, and just under $5 million to local governments for infrastructure repair.||Please note that best estimates will be included on a county by county basis as data is received through the rest of the year.  ||Storm total rainfall from the evening of July 22nd through the early afternoon of July 24th generally ranged from 4 to 10 inches in Kenedy, Brooks, Starr, Jim Hogg, and Zapata Counties, and 6 to 14 inches in  Hidalgo, Willacy, and Cameron Counties, with locally more than 18 inches possible in the persistent southern eyewall in northern Cameron and southern Willacy Counties.  Widespread freshwater flooding occurred in these areas as Dolly moved through, and low lying, poor drainage, or areas where drainage systems failed were flooded for days, and in some cases weeks, to come.||The late intensification of Dolly just prior to landfall, combined with a brief northward jog before turning to the west along the Cameron/Willacy County line, limited Gulf storm surge effects across the Town of South Padre Island through mid morning on the 23rd.  However, hurricane force west winds whipped an estimated 3 to 4 foot water rise from Laguna Madre across the Town, with water briefly stretching across the Island at the height of the event.  The town of Port Mansfield, immediately north of the center, estimated a 4 foot storm surge and 5 foot storm tide. ||Interestingly, tides to the north of Dolly's center initially fell to below predicted values on increasing northerly winds, before rising during the late afternoon and evening as the cyclone moved inland, and strong southerly flow piled a storm tide of up to 6 feet above Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) along the uninhabited Kenedy County shoreline.||There was a single confirmed tornado in Cameron County during the late evening of July 22nd, associated with one of the first outer rain bands.

Thunderstorms erupted over western Iowa stretching into north central Iowa first.  It did not take long for the storms to become severe with hail and high winds.  Most of the hail reported was in the pea to marble size, with the larger stones in the nickel to quarter size range.  The primary mode of severe weather was high winds and several tornadoes.  The secondary, but significant threat, was heavy rainfall.  A band of 3 to 5 inches of rain fell between U.S. Highway 30 and U.S. Highway 20 during the event.  The heaviest rainfall total was in Greene County at Jefferson, with 5.90 inches.  Tornadoes began to touch down in western Iowa in Crawford County with two brief touchdowns.  One was west of Dow City, causing roof and shingle damage to a farmhouse there.  The next was east of Denison where a barn roof was removed and a trailer house was destroyed.  A tornado in Carroll County caused damage to 3 farmsteads southeast of Templeton.  A machine shed was completely destroyed and numerous other buildings sustained damage.  Trees also had substantial damage. Two tornadoes touched down in Calhoun County.  One near Farnhamville, tore the roof off of a home and downed power lines.  The second caused damage to trees, outbuildings, and power lines on four farmsteads.  Farther south, a brief touchdown was reported in Dallas County in open fields west of Minburn.  Another tornado touched down in Dallas County later on, west of Adel, and was on the ground for about 4 miles.  A more substantial tornado touched down near Murray in Clarke County with one reported on the ground for about 9 miles.  As the storms moved east, another tornado was on the ground for over 10 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The most significant tornado occurred in Marion and Mahaska Counties where an EF2 tornado was on the ground for about 18 miles.  Several homes were damaged along its path, two mobile homes were destroyed, and considerable damage was done to trees in the area.  Up to 10 people were injured with this tornado, mainly in Attica.  The official damage count from this tornado included 5 homes destroyed, 15 with major damage, and another 25 with minor damage.  Many of the storms produced high winds with several reports of winds in the 65 to 75 MPH range.  Considerable tree damage was reported and some structural damage, mainly outbuildings and shingle damage.  Two cars were blown off of the road east of Manning by the high winds.  Building debris was blown onto Highway D60 near Gowrie, causing a brief closure.

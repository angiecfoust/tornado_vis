This event occurred within a large stratiform rain shield associated with a tropical disturbance which was later classified as Tropical Storm Barry in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.,"A tornado touched down at 1155 EST June 1st along Mira Road on Sugarloaf Key, downing a 30-foot Ficus tree, damaging a screen porch and scattering loose items stored underneath an elevated home.  The tornado likely had an intermittent north northwest path partially over water, before damging a home on Hawksbill Road along the northeast portion of Sugarloaf Key.  An enclosed patio along the back portion of the home had been destroyed, allowing metal covering to peel back on roughly one third of the home. No other homes were damaged, including one across a canal directly in the path of the tornado. Therefore it was concluded the the roof covering failure without any wood roof decking failures occurred due to the failure of the light wood porch.  Heavy rain was noted which also may have caused excessive loads on the screens, contributing to porch failure.  Therefore the maximum damage rating for the entire event was set at EF0.",CSV

The storms produce spotty heavy rainfall as they tracked slowly northward along IH-35.  One of the thunderstorms developed into a supercell and produced a brief tornado near San Marcos.  Additional strong storms later formed along the front and produced additional spotty heavy rain along the IH-35 corridor as the front moved southward, with some areas experiencing flash flooding.","Much more severe damage was seen near the center of this path at Police Headquarters.  Just south of the building, metal roofs had been torn off a structure and tossed toward the north.  In the south parking lot adjacent to the building, three telephone poles were blown down...one toward the west���one toward the north���and one toward the south.

A large area of brick was ejected from an upper portion of the Building���s north wall.  The conclusion of the survey team was that this damage at the Police Headquarters was due to a small and short-lived tornado that occurred just behind the 70 to 80 mph thunderstorm winds. Damage was also found about 200 yards north of the Police Building at a business that manufactures lighting fixtures.  This was thought to be a second touchdown of the small tornado.  Here a large dumpster was spun almost 360 degrees and several trailers were slammed into each other. A single-wide trailer was tipped over on its side.

Severe weather during the overnight hours in June is quite rare but does occur on occasion. One of the overnight storms actually produced a rare June tornado! This overnight severe weather was likely a sign and just a taste of what was to come during the day on June 19th. As the overnight/early morning complex of storms shifted east, conditions were set just right for additional storms to redevelop to the west by late morning. The atmosphere recovered once more and became quite unstable in the wake of the morning complex. A very potent disturbance dropped south out of Arkansas and developed a large bow echo complex which plowed south across the forecast area. This bow echo was very efficient at producing severe wind gusts and a large swath of wind damage occurred as the system moved southward across Mississippi into Southeast Louisiana.","This tornado touched down about 1/2 a mile south of the lake shore. Damage  consisted of numerous trees uprooted, snapped or had large limbs torn off. Many power lines were also taken down by the trees and large limbs. Most of the trees were laid to the north/northeast with about 25% of them down to the southeast/east, opposite of the storm motion. The most concentrated damage occurred along the south end of the lake shore where a small cluster of cypress trees were snapped or had many large limbs torn off. The tornado then moved across the lake and to a point at the mouth of the chute. Here, many more trees, limbs and power lines were damaged or torn down along with shingles taken off a few homes. The roof of a patio was pealed back and blown over the main house. There was also a trampoline that was mangled and deposited into a tree some 25 feet up.",CSV

It remained over unpopulated desert terrain and thus no damage occurred. The tornado lasted far longer than one would expect for a landspout.

The air mass was very unstable, such that any ground based circulation (e.g. gustnadoes) would quickly spin up within strong updrafts. One technician near White Sands Missle Range HQ observed a gustnado along a gust front from a storm farther west grow rapidly upward under a strong thunderstorm. Once the landspout had formed, it moved slowly northeast but persisted for more than 40 minutes (52 minutes according to NSSL). It remained over unpopulated desert terrain and thus no damage occurred. The tornado lasted far longer than one would expect for a landspout. It was concluded that since it connected with a cell that had supercellular tendencies, this accounted for the longevity. Due to the somewhat high thunderstorm base and little precipitation around the funnel, the tornado was easily viewed by El Paso residents up to 30 miles away.

The cold front advanced across the state accompanied by a strong upper level short wave.  Severe parameters were not all that impressive, however it was a case of low top convection close to the upper low.  The zero to 1 km helicity was quite high, in the 350 to 400 J/kg range and there was significant shear with effective shear in the 50 to 60 kt range.  Other parameters were not all that impressive with most unstable CAPE in the 500 to 1000 J/kg range and lifted indices between zero and -3 C.  The downdraft CAPE was around 500 J/kg with only about 100 J/kg of CAPE available in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere.  The LCL was quite low given the saturation caused from the previous convection.  It was between 750 and 1000 meters.  As the line of convection from the morning shifted to the east, a narrow line of strong thunderstorms developed along the cold front and the approach of the upper low.  Initially, downburst winds occurred with the line with winds estimated around 65 MPH south of New Market in Taylor County.  A short distance to the west of the CWA, a 75 MPH wind gust occurred at an RWIS site.  As the storms raced east they produced gusty winds and very heavy rainfall.  The storms produced a small, but intense, tornado in downtown Des Moines.  Two power poles snapped and power lines down at 13th and Mulberry. At 6th and Mulberry, two vehicles were flipped including one SUV that was likely flipped nose down due to engine weight. The SUV slid about 30 feet.

The tornado tore metal roofing off his shed. The tornado curved through town, blowing open doors at a school but causing little damage to the school. Windows were blown out of a church and a large tree feel to the west, knocking out power. A fabric roof was partially torn off a hoop storage shed at the elevator in town.

Another metal building had partial peeling of the side paneling, a large garage door blown in and the business���s dumpster was rolled 100 ft to the west.

Two businesses just south southwest of the touchdown point also had damage to their garage doors.||Directly across I-40 from the touchdown point was a car dealership.  The main building at the dealership had minimal damage and most vehicles in the lot had no damage.  One light pole was knocked over and a large sign for the dealership was damaged. A double wide mobile home, which was used as an office at the dealership, was knocked over on its side.  Several cars towards the extreme northwest corner of the lot exhibited damage though the original locations of the vehicles are in question.  Billboards around the lot were either destroyed or folded over.  Farther to the northwest a farm house with outbuildings sustained damage.  Most damage appeared to be suffered by the outbuildings.  The damage appeared minor with roof and side panels peeled, though one of the buildings sustained some damage to its structure.  The tornado then entered into an industrial area.  A building west of the farm house sustained damage to its office area and a section of side paneling was peeled.  Roofing from the Oklahoma Gas and Electric building, which was across the street, also impacted the northeast corner of the building with enough force to cause a significant dent in the panel.  A flag pole at this building was also bent about 50 degrees.  The building seemed to have sustained the most damage in the area.  It appeared most of the roof was gone, a tree was snapped in two and the power lines were snapped in two.  Further, the roof of the small office area appeared to have been partially lifted.  A pole near the building also appears to have bent a bit.  Other buildings near the building had other damage to siding and roofs.||Along Hwy 81, north of Oklahoma Gas and Electric, several buildings in the industrial/commercial area sustained damage.  A convenience store had its windows blown out, a garage door blown out, and a portion of the roof was removed.  Metal framed buildings to the west of this area failed at the ends of the buildings but the center portions of the framing remained intact.  One structure in particular lost most of its roof and it is believed that this roof actually scraped along and removed the roof to a small strip mall.  A metal building to the north of this strip mall had a garage door blown in and two panels were pushed in towards the bottom of the panel on its south side.  On the north side the building had 3 garage doors blown in and the northeast corner sustained side panel damage.  Across Hwy 81, a snow cone hut was spun about 270 degrees and a metal lining peeled off.  Two metal light poles near the hut were damaged; one was bent and another was snapped off its base.  To the north of this area a building sustained damage to its roof.   People were present inside the building when it was struck but no one was injured.  Three power poles, one towards the highway and two near the building were snapped.  A storage shed on the north side of the building's parking lot had a garage door blown in; also, plastic skylights were blown out to locations unknown.  Power poles just to the north along a side road were blown over and one was snapped.  West of this location was a farm supply store which had grain bins blown over and some into a nearby pond.  North of the store was a cluster of trees which had a variety of damage.  The final damage points were along Choctaw Rd.  At the corner of Choctaw and Elm, a metal building had its roof rotated on top it and a power pole near it was snapped.  The neighborhood west of Choctaw Rd had some tree and power pole damage.  Also the neighborhood northeast of Hwy 81 and Elm sustained probable microburst damage.  Monetary damages were estimated.",CSV

These winds were felt at the surface to some degree as a large area across the Lower Mississippi River Valley saw sustained winds between 25-35 mph with gusts between 40-50 mph. Those gradient winds, in advance of the severe weather, were strong enough to down some trees and power lines across the region.

The strong winds allowed for the environment to become highly sheared. Basically, there were increasing winds with height and a change in the wind direction as well.

However, this set the stage for a severe weather outbreak which included numerous reports of damaging winds, large hail and a few tornadoes.","This tornado touched down in Jonesville and heavily damaged or destroyed 6 mobile homes and caused minor damage to 3 other homes.

This helped push the convection east during the overnight hours.  Strong cells developed in southwest Iowa near the warm frontal boundary.  Two tornadoes occurred with this initial set of convection.  An EF2 tornado touched down in Cass County.    The tornado first developed right on the southern Cass County line, from highway 71 to three quarters of a mile west. Four farmsteads were damaged along county road G66 within the mile west of highway 71, producing damage up to EF1.  The tornado narrowed slightly and intensified in the next mile, downing two sets of metal electrical transmission poles.

EF2 damage occurred at this site with winds estimated at 120-130 mph.  The average path width was 100 to 200 yards, with a maximum width of about one half mile.  Empty semi trailers were flipped, two tall grain bins were flattened.  A large metal clad truck service building was flattened on the south end and much of the roof was off the north end. The west part of the roof of an office building was torn off and the wall collapsed. The house at the north end of the site had windows blown out and part of the roof damaged.  The tornado continued north along and just east of highway 71 for another two miles causing some damage to homes with some outbuildings unroofed or destroyed.  The last apparent damage along the tornado path occurred two miles northeast of Lyman where power poles were snapped.  Several areas between Cumberland and Anita were also surveyed. Damage along this path was consistent with straight line winds of 70 to 90 mph.  Damage included downed trees and sheet metal torn off sheds and outbuildings.  A storage building in Anita was significantly damaged.  A total of 115 to 120 homes were damaged in Cass County by the storm.  As the night progressed, a bow echo advanced into the state from the southwest.  There were several reports of high winds and hail with this line.  One of the storm in the line produced a small EF0 tornado in Union County.  Some damage occurred at several farmsteads along the path.  This same cell produced very large hail with hail up to baseball size reported in the Afton area.  The hail was wind driven, damaging skylights, windows, and cars.  Hail stones were driven through car windshields and also through windows in houses.  Some damage even occurred inside of two homes as the hail stones continued inside of the house.  This was the most significant hail from the storms.  The hail reportedly piled up several inches deep and lasted for at least 4 hours after the storm.  In the survey conducted by the Emergency Manager it was found that in Afton, 236 primary buildings and 174 out buildings and garages had  moderate hail damage consisting of roof damage...primarily to the slopes facing south and west.  All roof vents and eves, either aluminum or plastic, were damaged. Almost 100 percent of the buildings with south-facing windows had damage to screens, broken glass storm windows, interior single and double pane windows, and in cases of plastic framed windows even the sashes and stools were damaged. All siding was damaged on those sides no matter of the material.  In the rural areas around Afton, 30 of the 38 residences received moderate damage.  In Arispe, 5 miles south of Afton, hail damage occurred, but was not as severe with 40 residences reporting minor damage and 30 out buildings being damaged.  All together, 346 vehicles were hail damaged and many had Windows broken completely out. Twenty three campers suffered vent and sky lite damages as well as exterior damages. Hardly any of the skylights withstood the hail, either in campers or houses.  Though many of the storms produced hail, much of it was under one half inch in diameter.  Another brief tornado touched town in Guthrie County south of Bayard.  The tornado caused EF1 damage.  A roof was blown off of a building there, and blown westward.  Wind was the primary threat with the storms.  There were several reports of trees downed by the high winds, barns, and outbuildings being blown over or destroyed.  A semi-tractortrailer was blown off of Interstate 80 west of Adair.  The event turned into a significant event both in areal coverage, as well as for its variety of weather features.  Flooding became a significant problem later in the event with several reports of 3 to 5 inch rainfall received.  Flash flooding occurred over parts of southwest into west central Iowa.  Cass, Audubon, and Carroll Counties were the hardest hit.  Areal flood warnings were issued for these counties.  Widespread flooding too place, with Cass County hard hit.  The Governor of Iowa, Chet Culver, declared a state disaster for several counties across southwest and south central Iowa due to the flash flooding.

Precipitable water values were in the 1.5 to 1.75 inch range by midnight.  The lifted index fell to the -6 to -8 C. There was a reasonable amount of CAPE available with about 2500 J/kg at the onset of the event.  The LCL was around 1000 meters and the freezing level was a relatively high 13,500 feet.  With the warm front in the vicinity, there was a considerable amount of helicity present with values in the 300 to 550 range.  During the evening of the 5th, most of the significant convection remained to the west of the DMX CWA.  After midnight, the low level jet increased to 50 to 70 kts and began to veer.  This helped push the convection east during the overnight hours.  Strong cells developed in southwest Iowa near the warm frontal boundary.  Two tornadoes occurred with this initial set of convection.  An EF2 tornado touched down in Cass County.    The tornado first developed right on the southern Cass County line, from highway 71 to three quarters of a mile west. Four farmsteads were damaged along county road G66 within the mile west of highway 71, producing damage up to EF1.  The tornado narrowed slightly and intensified in the next mile, downing two sets of metal electrical transmission poles. The most severe damage occurred at a farm service and grain elevator business on highway 71.  This was 2 miles into Cass County or 3 miles south of the town of Lyman.  EF2 damage occurred at this site with winds estimated at 120-130 mph.  The average path width was 100 to 200 yards, with a maximum width of about one half mile.  Empty semi trailers were flipped, two tall grain bins were flattened.  A large metal clad truck service building was flattened on the south end and much of the roof was off the north end. The west part of the roof of an office building was torn off and the wall collapsed. The house at the north end of the site had windows blown out and part of the roof damaged.  The tornado continued north along and just east of highway 71 for another two miles causing some damage to homes with some outbuildings unroofed or destroyed.  The last apparent damage along the tornado path occurred two miles northeast of Lyman where power poles were snapped.  Several areas between Cumberland and Anita were also surveyed. Damage along this path was consistent with straight line winds of 70 to 90 mph.  Damage included downed trees and sheet metal torn off sheds and outbuildings.  A storage building in Anita was significantly damaged.  A total of 115 to 120 homes were damaged in Cass County by the storm.  As the night progressed, a bow echo advanced into the state from the southwest.  There were several reports of high winds and hail with this line.  One of the storm in the line produced a small EF0 tornado in Union County.  Some damage occurred at several farmsteads along the path.  This same cell produced very large hail with hail up to baseball size reported in the Afton area.  The hail was wind driven, damaging skylights, windows, and cars.  Hail stones were driven through car windshields and also through windows in houses.  Some damage even occurred inside of two homes as the hail stones continued inside of the house.  This was the most significant hail from the storms.  The hail reportedly piled up several inches deep and lasted for at least 4 hours after the storm.  In the survey conducted by the Emergency Manager it was found that in Afton, 236 primary buildings and 174 out buildings and garages had  moderate hail damage consisting of roof damage...primarily to the slopes facing south and west.  All roof vents and eves, either aluminum or plastic, were damaged. Almost 100 percent of the buildings with south-facing windows had damage to screens, broken glass storm windows, interior single and double pane windows, and in cases of plastic framed windows even the sashes and stools were damaged. All siding was damaged on those sides no matter of the material.  In the rural areas around Afton, 30 of the 38 residences received moderate damage.  In Arispe, 5 miles south of Afton, hail damage occurred, but was not as severe with 40 residences reporting minor damage and 30 out buildings being damaged.  All together, 346 vehicles were hail damaged and many had Windows broken completely out. Twenty three campers suffered vent and sky lite damages as well as exterior damages. Hardly any of the skylights withstood the hail, either in campers or houses.  Though many of the storms produced hail, much of it was under one half inch in diameter.  Another brief tornado touched town in Guthrie County south of Bayard.  The tornado caused EF1 damage.  A roof was blown off of a building there, and blown westward.  Wind was the primary threat with the storms.  There were several reports of trees downed by the high winds, barns, and outbuildings being blown over or destroyed.  A semi-tractortrailer was blown off of Interstate 80 west of Adair.  The event turned into a significant event both in areal coverage, as well as for its variety of weather features.  Flooding became a significant problem later in the event with several reports of 3 to 5 inch rainfall received.  Flash flooding occurred over parts of southwest into west central Iowa.  Cass, Audubon, and Carroll Counties were the hardest hit.  Areal flood warnings were issued for these counties.  Widespread flooding too place, with Cass County hard hit.  The Governor of Iowa, Chet Culver, declared a state disaster for several counties across southwest and south central Iowa due to the flash flooding.  This included Decatur County in the Des Moines CWA.  Toward dawn, high winds became a problem over parts of northwest Iowa.  The winds affected  a 6 county area with wind gusts in the 50 to 65 MPH range for several hours.","Tornado was on the ground briefly, but took the roof off of a building and blew it westward.",CSV

The average date for isolated first reports of damaging hail over the past 20 years has been March 24th with the location typically confined to far southeast New Mexico. The March 23rd 2007 episode produced a number of large hail events from Roswell to Tucumcari and peaked with multiple tornadoes from near Tatum north to Clovis and northeast of Tucumcari. A tornado at Clovis resulted in the death of two elderly citizens, the first tornado fatalities in New Mexico since October of 1974. The episode was characterized by a slow moving upper level low that produced strong speed shear but nearly uniform southerly directional flow aloft across the eastern and southeastern sections of the state. Storms with large hail developed first during early and mid afternoon from near Roswell north to Tucumcari. Towards late afternoon and early evening as storms migrated north northeast they encountered an increasing but shallow easterly surface flow that enhanced low level shear resulting in brief but shallow tornadoes. Multiple small but elevated vortices were observed circulating around well defined wall clouds with occasional spin downs into brief tornadoes.",A tornado that developed in Roosevelt County continued north northwest into Curry County for about 3.5 miles then tracked north northeast an additional 4.6 miles into southern and east central sections of Clovis. Intensity of the tornado appeared to wane from EF2 120 mph in Roosevelt County to EF1 100 mph as it moved north into Curry County along Highway 70 where damage was limited to power lines and farm irrigation equipment. Intensity increased again to EF2 level 125 mph for a segment extending from about 4 miles south of Clovis northward into southeast Clovis which sustained the heaviest and most consistent damage as indicated by structural damage and downed power poles. The tornado appeared to wane again as it move north over Highway 60/84 just east of the intersection with Highway 70. The tornado track became intermittent north of Highway 60/84 with winds likely less than 85 mph before a final one half mile track of heavier damage and EF2 level winds of 120-125 mph.

The team found the tornado touchdown point approximately one-quarter mile to the southwest of the Rosita Valley Elementary School. It struck a four room home��� destroying the outer walls and leaving only the interior walls standing. This damage was rated as EF-2 damage. The tornado then moved toward the east-northeast, directly toward the school. Along its path it damaged three more homes and destroyed a fourth. Damage to the three homes was rated EF-1 with the destroyed home rated EF-2. The tornado next struck a mobile home, tearing off its frame and tossing the debris into the school building.

Then the tornado crossed Rosita Valley Road, destroying mobile homes and damaging homes and tossing the debris into the south and west sides of the Rosita Valley Elementary School building. The initial strike points at the school showed only minor EF-0 damage. However damage was severe from the center of the school northeastward. It appeared that the tornadic winds were able to open enough of the center part of the roof to enter the interior of the school. These winds as well as winds that entered through wall openings caused severe damage to the north and south wings of the building. This damage indicated wind speeds approaching 140 mph and damage at EF-3 level. To the northwest of the school were two brick retail buildings; both were well-constructed. Outer walls were destroyed in each with damage to interior walls in one of the structures. This also suggested wind speeds near 140 mph and EF-3 level damage.|Finally as the tornado exited the school area it struck an area of single family houses some 200 yards to the northeast. Most of the houses were swept off their foundations and many of them were completely flattened. This damage suggested wind speeds approaching 150 mph, the highest speeds found at Rosita Valley.

The situation was complicated by the convection that occurred during the previous night.  An outflow boundary from the previous nights convection pushed south across the CWA, reaching the southern part by sunrise.  This boundary combined with a quasi-stationary frontal boundary that was across the southern counties.  The atmosphere became unstable quite rapidly during the late morning and early afternoon.  Surface low pressure was located over southwest Iowa, with a warm front extending east  South of the warm front temperatures warmed to around 90 F. with dew points in the upper 60s to low 70s.  Surface based CAPE rose to 3000 to 4000 J/kg with the lifted index falling into the -8 to -10 C. range.  The cap broke by around 1800 UTC as an MCS began to develop over central Iowa.  The environment was fairly favorable with 30 to 40 kts of effective shear and precipitable water values around 1.5 inches.  Available cape in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was in the 300 to 500 J/kg range.  DCAPE values were between 600 and 800 J/kg.  Two tornadoes touched down in Warren County.  First indication of ground contact from the first tornado was adjacent to I-35 0.60 miles north of the Cumming, IA/G-14 interchange and approximately 1 mile NW of the town of Cumming.  Ground contact evident to the southeast along a path of approximately 125 degrees. First structural damage (EF1) noted at a farm house at G14 and 20th Ave.  Path width at this point estimated at 100 yards.  Continuous ground contact southeast to farmstead at G14 and 25th Ave where north facing garage was destroyed (EF1) and outbuildings and trailer damaged.  The tornado continued SE and reached widest point of approximately 200 yards striking outbuildings. Debris swath is noted to NE and also SE indicating the possibility of multi vortex circulation.  A farmstead at 30th Ave and Clark street sustained EF1 damage to grain bin and outbuildings. Path width approximately 150 yards. Corn from grain bin was noted well downstream at end of track, some corn impacted side of Phillips home in SE Norwalk.  Continuous ground contact ended and path narrowed considerably just north of Clarke St. near the Happy Apple Orchard. This resulted in a continuous tornado path of 2.2 miles.  Intermittent damage path continued SE for 1.5 miles across fields and wooded areas with path of 30 to 50 yards. Next structural damage occurred to a light garage (EF0).  The track turned E/NE Approximately  080 degrees for .6 mile, with intermittent damage consisting of snapped and mangled trees. Path width 30 to 50 yards. Mature  2' diameter trees along farm pond snapped at trunk and tops of trees deposited to the NE. The track turns SE for .75 mile before again turning E/NE.  Narrow swath of tree damage noted.  The track continues ENE (approximately 070 degrees) across Highway 28 where EF0 damage was noted. Ground scouring/swirl marks noted along 1.9 mile track ending at the Phillips home on the SE corner of Norwalk where EF2 damage was observed. Tornado appeared to quickly dissipate on the NE of the home. Maximum path width 200 yards along the over 7 mile long track.  The second tornado was first verified over the Legacy Golf Course, just NW of the Norwalk Fire Station.  It is interesting to note the tornado passed directly over the fire station, producing a circular pattern in the gravel on the roof, and blowing out two overhead doors.  The tornado was narrow, with most damage consisting of tree damage up to EF1 and light structural damage as it moved to the SE.   The path width ranges from 10 yards to a maximum of approximately 100-150 yards.  This NW to SE tornado path crossed less than .25 miles of the path of the West to East moving Cumming to Norwalk Tornado.  A farmstead on R57 south of Coolidge St. sustained tree damage from tornado #2.  This is just south of the Phillips home that was damaged by the first tornado.  Winds were estimated at 125 MPH in the first tornado, and 100 MPH in the second.   Fortunately, there were no injuries during the tornado occurrences themselves, however one person was injured during recovery.  LCL levels were lower than the previous day, in the 750 to 1000 meter range.  As the complex evolved, the primary modes of severe weather were hail and high wind.  The freezing level was lower than the previous day, at 13,900 feet and many of the storms contained at least some hail.  The hail was not overly large, with most reports in the three quarter to one inch range.  During the storms evolution, there were several bow echo segments, resulting in high winds.  Winds of 80 MPH occurred southwest of Norwalk, in the rear flank downdraft of the supercell over the county in association with the tornadoes.  Some of the other high winds included a wind gust of near 85 MPH in Madison County where a house had about one third of the shingles removed and a northeast facing overhang removed, 78 MPH in Tama, and 75 MPH at the Des Moines Airport, and 65 MPH in Carroll.  A downburst occurred in Marion County south-southwest of Pleasantville, with winds estimated to 60 MPH.  The storms were prolific rainfall producers.  Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches was  common in central, into north central and parts of northeast Iowa.  Spotty reports of up to 6 inches in a 2 to 3 hour period were received.   There were numerous reports of water flowing over highways as well as bridge and highway washouts.","Tornado spotted by the Norwalk Fire Department, law enforcement, Warren County Emergency Manager, and trained spotters.

The situation was complicated by the convection that occurred during the previous night.  An outflow boundary from the previous nights convection pushed south across the CWA, reaching the southern part by sunrise.  This boundary combined with a quasi-stationary frontal boundary that was across the southern counties.  The atmosphere became unstable quite rapidly during the late morning and early afternoon.  Surface low pressure was located over southwest Iowa, with a warm front extending east  South of the warm front temperatures warmed to around 90 F. with dew points in the upper 60s to low 70s.  Surface based CAPE rose to 3000 to 4000 J/kg with the lifted index falling into the -8 to -10 C. range.  The cap broke by around 1800 UTC as an MCS began to develop over central Iowa.  The environment was fairly favorable with 30 to 40 kts of effective shear and precipitable water values around 1.5 inches.  Available cape in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was in the 300 to 500 J/kg range.  DCAPE values were between 600 and 800 J/kg.  Two tornadoes touched down in Warren County.  First indication of ground contact from the first tornado was adjacent to I-35 0.60 miles north of the Cumming, IA/G-14 interchange and approximately 1 mile NW of the town of Cumming.  Ground contact evident to the southeast along a path of approximately 125 degrees. First structural damage (EF1) noted at a farm house at G14 and 20th Ave.  Path width at this point estimated at 100 yards.  Continuous ground contact southeast to farmstead at G14 and 25th Ave where north facing garage was destroyed (EF1) and outbuildings and trailer damaged.  The tornado continued SE and reached widest point of approximately 200 yards striking outbuildings. Debris swath is noted to NE and also SE indicating the possibility of multi vortex circulation.  A farmstead at 30th Ave and Clark street sustained EF1 damage to grain bin and outbuildings. Path width approximately 150 yards. Corn from grain bin was noted well downstream at end of track, some corn impacted side of Phillips home in SE Norwalk.  Continuous ground contact ended and path narrowed considerably just north of Clarke St. near the Happy Apple Orchard. This resulted in a continuous tornado path of 2.2 miles.  Intermittent damage path continued SE for 1.5 miles across fields and wooded areas with path of 30 to 50 yards. Next structural damage occurred to a light garage (EF0).  The track turned E/NE Approximately  080 degrees for .6 mile, with intermittent damage consisting of snapped and mangled trees. Path width 30 to 50 yards. Mature  2' diameter trees along farm pond snapped at trunk and tops of trees deposited to the NE. The track turns SE for .75 mile before again turning E/NE.  Narrow swath of tree damage noted.  The track continues ENE (approximately 070 degrees) across Highway 28 where EF0 damage was noted. Ground scouring/swirl marks noted along 1.9 mile track ending at the Phillips home on the SE corner of Norwalk where EF2 damage was observed. Tornado appeared to quickly dissipate on the NE of the home. Maximum path width 200 yards along the over 7 mile long track.  The second tornado was first verified over the Legacy Golf Course, just NW of the Norwalk Fire Station.  It is interesting to note the tornado passed directly over the fire station, producing a circular pattern in the gravel on the roof, and blowing out two overhead doors.  The tornado was narrow, with most damage consisting of tree damage up to EF1 and light structural damage as it moved to the SE.   The path width ranges from 10 yards to a maximum of approximately 100-150 yards.  This NW to SE tornado path crossed less than .25 miles of the path of the West to East moving Cumming to Norwalk Tornado.  A farmstead on R57 south of Coolidge St. sustained tree damage from tornado #2.  This is just south of the Phillips home that was damaged by the first tornado.  Winds were estimated at 125 MPH in the first tornado, and 100 MPH in the second.   Fortunately, there were no injuries during the tornado occurrences themselves, however one person was injured during recovery.  LCL levels were lower than the previous day, in the 750 to 1000 meter range.  As the complex evolved, the primary modes of severe weather were hail and high wind.  The freezing level was lower than the previous day, at 13,900 feet and many of the storms contained at least some hail.  The hail was not overly large, with most reports in the three quarter to one inch range.  During the storms evolution, there were several bow echo segments, resulting in high winds.  Winds of 80 MPH occurred southwest of Norwalk, in the rear flank downdraft of the supercell over the county in association with the tornadoes.  Some of the other high winds included a wind gust of near 85 MPH in Madison County where a house had about one third of the shingles removed and a northeast facing overhang removed, 78 MPH in Tama, and 75 MPH at the Des Moines Airport, and 65 MPH in Carroll.  A downburst occurred in Marion County south-southwest of Pleasantville, with winds estimated to 60 MPH.  The storms were prolific rainfall producers.  Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches was  common in central, into north central and parts of northeast Iowa.  Spotty reports of up to 6 inches in a 2 to 3 hour period were received.   There were numerous reports of water flowing over highways as well as bridge and highway washouts.","Tornado spotted by amateur radio, law enforcement, Warren County Emergency Manager, and trained spotters.

Four people sustained minor injuries, and total damage from the storms exceeded $60 million.||The first tornado of the outbreak moved across eastern Marathon County shortly after 4:00 PM CDT, producing damage to several homes.  The tornado was rated EF2.||A second thunderstorm produced a weak tornado in Wood County, which was rated EF0.  The same storm responsible for this tornado produced softball size hail that damaged thousands of homes, several businesses and hundreds of vehicles.  One hailstone that fell in Port Edwards measured 5.50 inches in diameter, making it the second largest hailstone on record in Wisconsin.||The same supercell thunderstorm that produced the Marathon County tornado also produced a long-track tornado across northeast Shawano, northwest Menominee, southeast Langlade and northern Oconto counties.  This tornado was on the ground for 47 minutes, covering 40.1 miles, and destroyed 14,400 acres of woodlands (timber loss was estimated at $12.5 million) and dozens of buildings along its path.  The twister, which was over one-half mile at times, was rated EF3, with peak winds estimated of 150 to 160 mph.  The storm responsible for the tornado also produced significant straight-line wind damage as it moved into western Marinette County.  ||The fourth tornado of the outbreak, rated EF1, developed near Cedarville in Marinette Co., which was from the same thunderstorm that produced the long-track tornado. ||The final tornado of the afternoon and evening touched down near Harmony in Marinette Co.  This tornado was rated EF1.||Details of the tornadoes, hail, and wind damage can be found in the event narratives of the affected counties.","This tornado was the last one of the evening.  The tornado touched down at 6:16 PM about 6 miles southwest of Porterfield, and was on the ground for about 4 minutes, dissipating 2.9 miles south-southwest of Porterfield.  One person was injured by flying debris as they sought refuge in their home.  The tornado flattened a barn (DI 1, DOD 7), tore a significant part of the sheet metal roof from an outbuilding, blew in the garage door and tore part of the roof deck over the garage from a home that was under construction (DI 2, DOD 4), did minor roof damage at a residence, and uprooted large trees.  The tornado was rated EF1 with estimated winds of 90 to 100 mph.  Average path width was 125 yards.",CSV

The pattern of damage was consistent with that of an EF-1 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. The degree of damage, which consisted mainly of snapped off and uprooted trees, indicated that maximum wind speeds were around 90 mph. ||The tornado touched down in Sheldrake, near the northern end of Wyers Point Road, just east of State Route 89 and near the western shore of Cayuga Lake at about 3:46 pm EDT. The tornado then tracked southeast for about 1.5 miles, nearly parallel to both Wyers Point Road and the Cayuga Lake shoreline. The observed damage had a width of up to about 100 yards. Numerous trees sustained damage along this path length. Several very large trees were uprooted, and many more were snapped off. Utility poles in this same vicinity were either knocked down or sheared off. The orientation of the tree damage suggested a pattern of cyclonic rotation. Eyewitness accounts also detail both violently rotating debris just above ground level, and visual sighting of a funnel down to the surface near the shoreline. Any observed structural damage was relatively minor. A metal road sign was uprooted and blown across County Route 139, and a garage just off Wyers Point Road sustained roof damage from fallen trees. The tornado eventually crossed County Route 139 before emerging over the waters of Cayuga Lake between 3:50 and 3:55 pm EDT. ||At that point, evidence suggests that the tornado lifted back toward the cloud base over the open waters of Cayuga Lake. One eyewitness account from the King's Ferry Fire Station, which was about 2 miles east of the storm at this time, sighted a funnel cloud over Cayuga Lake, with the funnel observed to be well above the surface of the water.",CSV

An agricultural company, the towns largest employer, had its buildings heavily damaged. A nearby construction company lost two large steel buildings and other equipment. Steel beams from the two steel buildings were twisted and tossed nearby. Finally, a car dealership lost 15 to 20 vehicles from its parking lot along highway 15. Many of these vehicles were damaged beyond recognition and tossed into nearby fields.

The temperature across the boundary ranged from 89F at Minot, to 73F at Devils Lake, to 64F at Crookston. The upper air pattern had a western ridge and an eastern trough, putting the northern plains in northwest flow aloft. A strengthening upper jet also moved toward eastern North Dakota, giving this system good surface and upper level support.||A supercell thunderstorm developed over southern Steele County around 530 pm CST and tracked across western Cass County and into eastern Ransom County before weakening after 7 pm CST. Then, another supercell thunderstorm formed over northern Steele County around 725 pm CST. This storm tracked just west of the path of the first storm, again mainly hitting central Steele County, western Cass County, and eastern Ransom County, before weakening around 915 pm CST. Both thunderstorms tracked south-southeast at speeds between 40 and 50 mph and spawned multiple tornadoes which were embedded within the overall downburst wind and hail pattern.||The significant downburst wind and wind driven hail was seen in two partially overlapping paths, with each path from 5 to 7 miles wide and between 60 and 80 miles long (this damage path showed up clearly on satellite images). The strength of these winds is believed to have exceeded 80 mph with speeds over 100 mph in some localized areas. Hail sizes ranged from penny to hen egg sized.||Most areas received considerable hail damage at the same time as the strong winds. Law enforcement officials and witnesses stated that the hail often persisted for longer than 5 minutes and completely covered the ground. The hail damaged roofs, windows, and siding in many homes along the damage path. Stripped and decimated corn, bean, and wheat fields were typical along the entire storm path too. The ND Farm Service Administration estimated losses occurred on over 700,000 acres in five counties. Total crop losses may exceed $250 million, with other property losses from $15 to $20 million.

By the early evening, the surface low became stacked with the upper low and was located over eastern Nebraska.  A defined dry line extended south-southeast out of the low.  Surface temperatures warmed into the mid 70s to mid 80s ahead of the low, with dew points in the mid to upper 60s.  Dew points behind the dry line dropped into the upper 30s to mid 40s.  The airmass became unstable by the late afternoon with CAPE values around 1000 J/kg and lifted indices in the -2 to -4 C. range.  Strong dynamics were in place with a 90 kt mid level jet in place, a low level jet of 60 to 70 kts, and an effective shear of 45 to 55 kts.

The storms became tornadic as the moved into central Iowa.  During the evening of Sunday 30 September 2007 two tornadoes struck portions of Marion, Jasper, Mahaska, and Poweshiek Counties.  The first tornado produced EF0 to EF2 damage along its track and was rated EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale with maximum winds of 125 mph.  The track was 22 miles in length from 4 miles northeast of Pella to 1 mile north of Interstate 80, 2 miles west of Malcom.  Much of the track was three to five tenths of a mile wide, but as wide as seven tenths of a mile at times.  The second, shorter and weaker tornado was 5 miles in length and rated EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  The track began just south of Highway 6, 2.75 miles northwest of Malcom with a maximum width of 150 yards narrowing to 25-50 yards.  The storm hit a farmstead just east of 110th street producing EF1 damage with speeds just under 100 mph.  The tornadoes caused extensive damage on a farmstead near Malcom with three barns totally destroyed.  The barns were 20 by 30 feet, 20 by 40 feet, and 60 by 100 feet.  In addition, numerous other damage reports came in from along the track.  Fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries from the tornadoes.

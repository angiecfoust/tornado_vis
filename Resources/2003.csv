An upper level disturbance interacted with a cold front to ignite thunderstorms that resulted in all modes of severe weather. Storms initially formed across the northwest parts of the Basin, with one of the first storms to show supercellular characteristics resulting in damaging hail between Kermit and Notrees. A supercell storm also developed in western Martin County, and propagated south into Midland County. This storm resulted in large hail and severe winds in Midland. Meanwhile, a large cluster of severe storms moved east across Ector County. These storm systems merged over eastern Ector and western Midland Counties, evolving into a large high precipitation supercell. Strong rear flank downdraft winds raked the city of Odessa on the storm's southern flank. Radar detected a strong low level circulation just west of the Midland International Airport, but storm spotters and post-event surveys found no evidence of a tornado. As the storm propagated southeast, damaging rear flank downdraft winds destroyed a carport along Farm to Market Road 1788 in western Midland County.In addition, a broken line of strong to severe thunderstorms developed within proximity to the frontal boundary over the northeast Permian Basin.

The storms interacted with a strong low level jet and as a result, some of the cells produced severe weather, in the form of strong winds. The most significant wind damage came with a storm that moved across Montgomery County. This storm briefly spawned an F0 tornado near Tribes Hill, with winds estimated between 60 and 70 mph, at 520 PM. An eyewitness indicated that a visible twister took the tops off several pine trees in his yard as it moved east. The twister then turned to the north and damaged a nearby home, taking shingles off the roof and competely destroying the deck awning on the house. The tornado was only about 10 yards wide and the swath was about 50 yards in length. Five minutes later, the same storm produced a microburst in the town of Amsterdam, as another eyewitness reported hearing howling winds which collapsed a small garage. The wind with this downburst was estimated between 60 and 80 mph. Also in Montgomery County, numerous trees and wires were blown down in the towns of Nelliston and Canajoharie. At nearly the same time, this line of storms in Johnstown, Fulton County, was producing wind gusts strong enough to blow the roof off a porch and garage on  Rt. 67 near the Johnstown Airport. Scattered wind damage was reported in Herkimer County. A wire was blown down along Rt. 28 in Old Forge and shingles were blown off a home 4 miles south of Mohawk. In the town of Mohawk, a barn was completely destroyed. Over an hour later, a second storm brought more trees and wires down in the towns of West Winfield and Columbia Center.

This supercell became the dominant storm just north of Abilene and continued to intensify as it moved across Shackelford county and continued east to near Ranger. One tornado was reported in extreme southern Jones county just north of Abilene and four more tornadoes were confirmed across southern Shackelford county.,This was the northern tornado track of the two that paralleled one another.  This tornado snapped and stripped large trees and ripped up some T post fence along it's path.  It seems that the tree damage was more severe on this track.,PDS

One tornado moved through the town of Deshler going from the southeast side of town to the west.  One man was killed in his garage before he was able to get to shelter.  Over 400 homes in Deshler were damaged with four being completely demolished.  Nearly 100 homes were moderately to severely damaged.

Boats were the only mode of travel through the business district.  Up to 15 residents had to be evacuated by the local Dive and Rescue team using jet skis.  The flooding was caused by extremely heavy rainfall in nearby Republic County, Kansas.Flooding and flash flooding was also a problem throughout Thayer county.  Rainfall of over 12 inches was reported about 5 miles north of Deshler.  Residents reported nearly 5 hours of constant, wind-driven rain.  Windows were blown out and the rain just poured into homes.  Widespread agricultural damage was done due to the rain.  The runoff in the Snake and Spring creeks ravaged Deshler, the town which had already been hammered by tornadoes that evening.  Flooding was concentrated in the southern part of town and most widespread near the park and fairgrounds.Major river flooding was reported along the Little Blue River from just west of Hebron to the Jefferson county line.  One man at his farmstead near Gilead had to be air lifted to safety by the National Guard as flooding waters rose on his property.  Dozens of county roads and bridges were damaged or destroyed.  U. S. Highway 81 was restricted to one lane travel at Hebron due to the high water on the road.  Portions of Highways 81, 136 and 9 were closed for a time due to high water.  The Big Sandy Creek flowed out of its banks at Alexandria and crested at 14.5 feet.  Water was flowing over the highway near town and filling back into the town's sewer drains.

One storm near Aurora produced very large hail.  One stone measured by an NWS Storm Survey team was determined to be the largest sized stone to fall in the United States.  It measured 7 inches in diameter and 18.75 inches in circumference.  Many other large stones were noted on the northern side of Aurora.  Given the lack of wind, damage was limited to roofs, a few windows and some crop land near town.  The storm also produced a couple of brief small tornadoes as it slowly moved through northern Hamilton county.At nearly the same time, another very slow moving storm produced several tornadoes, hail and extremely heavy rains in Thayer county. One tornado moved through the town of Deshler going from the southeast side of town to the west.  One man was killed in his garage before he was able to get to shelter.  Over 400 homes in Deshler were damaged with four being completely demolished.  Nearly 100 homes were moderately to severely damaged.  Six businesses in town were considered a complete loss and 25 others reportedly suffered moderate to severe damage.  Seven people were injured, most were minor and were from broken glass.  Later in the evening, a tornado was reported north of Bradshaw in York county.  Storm spotters about 1 mile west of the tornado saw debris being flung through the air.  A farmstead was hit with most of the damage done to an old barn.Despite ongoing drought conditions, widespread flooding was reported in Thayer and southern Fillmore counties.  The flash flood along the Rose Creek at Hubbell provided some of the worst damage.  Water was flowing into houses and businesses on main street to the tune of up to 5 feet deep.  Boats were the only mode of travel through the business district.  Up to 15 residents had to be evacuated by the local Dive and Rescue team using jet skis.  The flooding was caused by extremely heavy rainfall in nearby Republic County, Kansas.Flooding and flash flooding was also a problem throughout Thayer county.  Rainfall of over 12 inches was reported about 5 miles north of Deshler.  Residents reported nearly 5 hours of constant, wind-driven rain.  Windows were blown out and the rain just poured into homes.  Widespread agricultural damage was done due to the rain.  The runoff in the Snake and Spring creeks ravaged Deshler, the town which had already been hammered by tornadoes that evening.  Flooding was concentrated in the southern part of town and most widespread near the park and fairgrounds.Major river flooding was reported along the Little Blue River from just west of Hebron to the Jefferson county line.  One man at his farmstead near Gilead had to be air lifted to safety by the National Guard as flooding waters rose on his property.  Dozens of county roads and bridges were damaged or destroyed.  U. S. Highway 81 was restricted to one lane travel at Hebron due to the high water on the road.  Portions of Highways 81, 136 and 9 were closed for a time due to high water.  The Big Sandy Creek flowed out of its banks at Alexandria and crested at 14.5 feet.  Water was flowing over the highway near town and filling back into the town's sewer drains.  In all, several million dollars in damage was done by the flooding alone.  Some locals said this was the worst flooding in the area in 55 years.",The last of four tornadoes to occur near Deshler.  Damage was primarily to crops and pivot systems.,PDS

Later in the evening, a tornado was reported north of Bradshaw in York county.  Storm spotters about 1 mile west of the tornado saw debris being flung through the air.  A farmstead was hit with most of the damage done to an old barn.Despite ongoing drought conditions, widespread flooding was reported in Thayer and southern Fillmore counties.  The flash flood along the Rose Creek at Hubbell provided some of the worst damage.  Water was flowing into houses and businesses on main street to the tune of up to 5 feet deep.  Boats were the only mode of travel through the business district.  Up to 15 residents had to be evacuated by the local Dive and Rescue team using jet skis.  The flooding was caused by extremely heavy rainfall in nearby Republic County, Kansas.Flooding and flash flooding was also a problem throughout Thayer county.  Rainfall of over 12 inches was reported about 5 miles north of Deshler.  Residents reported nearly 5 hours of constant, wind-driven rain.  Windows were blown out and the rain just poured into homes.  Widespread agricultural damage was done due to the rain.  The runoff in the Snake and Spring creeks ravaged Deshler, the town which had already been hammered by tornadoes that evening.  Flooding was concentrated in the southern part of town and most widespread near the park and fairgrounds.Major river flooding was reported along the Little Blue River from just west of Hebron to the Jefferson county line.  One man at his farmstead near Gilead had to be air lifted to safety by the National Guard as flooding waters rose on his property.  Dozens of county roads and bridges were damaged or destroyed.  U. S. Highway 81 was restricted to one lane travel at Hebron due to the high water on the road.  Portions of Highways 81, 136 and 9 were closed for a time due to high water.  The Big Sandy Creek flowed out of its banks at Alexandria and crested at 14.5 feet.  Water was flowing over the highway near town and filling back into the town's sewer drains.  In all, several million dollars in damage was done by the flooding alone.  Some locals said this was the worst flooding in the area in 55 years.",A brief touch down occurred just west of Aurora and was observed by an off duty NWS meteorologist.,PDS

One supercell produced three tornadoes that affected Moore, southern Oklahoma City, Midwest City, and Choctaw. A few locations in Moore and southeast Oklahoma City had also been hit by an F5 tornado that moved through the area on May 3, 1999. The General Motors Plant in southeast Oklahoma City sustained some of the most significant damage. This event was the second tornadic event of the day. Several tornadoes moved across south central Oklahoma during the early morning hours of May 8th (refer to appropriate data). This event was also the first of two days in a row where the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area was affected by tornadoes (refer to May 9, 2003 data). These thunderstorms developed near and along a strong dryline located across central Oklahoma.","This F0 tornado was the second one produced by a supercell that moved across central Oklahoma producing three tornadoes. The tornado was viewed by many residents west of Moore and was also caught on video by several storm chasers. This tornado began northwest of the intersection of Southwest 149th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue and ended just to the northwest of the intersection of Southwest 134th Street (or Highway 37) and Santa Fe Avenue. The first evidence of damage was found near the intersection of Jamie Drive and Libby Street in far south Oklahoma City. Damage in this area was mostly in the form of trees and large branches snapped off. Structural damage was limited mostly to fences, awnings, outdoor recreational equipment, and at least one outdoor satellite dish. Several canoes from a back-yard pond were picked up and deposited 100 feet or more from their point of origin. A pontoon boat on a trailer was also overturned.The damage track initially went due east along Jamie Drive, but turned northeast before crossing Pennsylvania (or Penn) Avenue near South 140th Street. Damage along Penn was confined mostly to trees, with little evidence of structural damage except to a large barn, which was partially unroofed. Tornadic winds were confirmed in this area through video and eye witness accounts. However, a wider zone of relatively minor damage, mostly to trees or tree branches, indicated that the tornado in this area was embedded within a larger area of straight-line winds of the type known as a rear-flank downdraft, or RFD.The damage track then turned more east again, through largely open areas before reaching Blackwelder Avenue near Southwest 140th Street. Tree damage was more extensive in this area, but structural damage remained minor. The latter was limited to slight damage to several outbuildings and one residence; much of it appeared to be the result of fallen trees/branches.The tornado then veered more to the east-northeast again as it tracked through open country between Blackwelder and Western. It crossed Western Avenue just south of 134th Street, downing several power poles and causing some minor damage to the Villa Teresa School on Western Avenue. The F0 tornado continued east-northeast and crossed 134th roughly midway between Western and Santa Fe before ending just north of 134th Street.",PDS

The tornado began northwest of the intersection of Santa Fe Avenue and EW091 Road. Shortly after touching down, the tornado peeled the southwest side of a barn roof. The tornado entered the Davenport city limits causing minor tree damage. A metal roof was slightly peeled just north of the intersection of Broadway and Frisco Street. The tornado continued across southern and eastern portions of town downing tree limbs and breaking a few windows. On the east edge of Davenport, the left field light standards of the baseball field were blown over and a referee box behind home plate had blown north-northwestward about 30 feet and broken apart. The right field light standards appeared intact. The only notable damage in town was on the eastern edge (to the southwest of the baseball field) where a sturdy wood-frame car port was apparently lifted and then collapsed on the owner's SUV. Minor damage to shingles and siding continued as the tornado moved northeast towards Stroud.The first area of damage of note within Stroud occurred north of West Elm Street approximately 0.4 miles west of Highway 377. Numerous tree limbs and small decorative trees were downed along with sections of privacy fences blown over and shingle damage to several homes. As the tornado continued northeast, one of two areas of F1 damage was found near the center of town. A home just southwest of the corner of South 9th Avenue and West Oak Street had a missing roof. The home sustained the heaviest roof damage in the southwest corner where all ceiling joists were missing. The ceiling/roof section was found upside down about 100 feet northeast of the house with the ceiling fan still attached but badly damaged. The east half of the small house still had a ceiling. A car port on the north side of the house was still attached but showed cracks indicating it may have shifted. A small home behind this house had a portion of its roof and siding peeled off. Other nearby damage occurred just west of Highway 377, halfway between West Joe Street and West Hillcrest Street. An engineered metal storage building had the southeast corner of roof and east wall blown out with the south wall caved in.The other area of F1 damage began along the railroad tracks on North First Street just east of South 4th Avenue where an open metal storage structure collapsed. More damage was noted at a building behind the fire station (located just north of the railroad tracks and just east of North 3rd Avenue). The south-facing cinder block wall of this building fell outward. About half of the roofing material, including tar paper, was missing from this roof. Vehicle windows were also broken in this location.The remainder of damage in town was light, typified by shingles missing, large tree limbs downed, garage doors damaged, windows broken, and fences downed. The track appeared to end somewhat abruptly at the east edge of town, where a food storage facility and another industrial building did not appear to have much damage.In Stroud seventy homes were damaged with six rendered uninhabitable. Nine businesses were also damaged.",PDS

The damage in this area was a tree and many tree limbs downed. A house was damaged a quarter of a mile west of the intersection of Memorial Road and Dobbs Road. The house lost a room on the second floor on the south side of the house. The poorly attached roof was also lifted and thrown over with one large section staying almost intact. A shed to the north of the house was damaged with three large limbs from a silver maple found in and near the shed. A trampoline was thrown into trees about 20 yards away and bent around a trunk. A large cedar tree was also broken.The area along Dobbs Road from Memorial Road to approximately a half a mile north of Memorial Road sustained some damage. The majority of which was tree damage with many downed trees and tree limbs and several uprooted trees. An open shed, located 0.14 miles north of the intersection, had its roof peeled back towards the northeast. A mobile home also sustained some light damage in this same location. A small shed was found overturned 0.25 miles north of Memorial Road, along with sheet metal in field and a tree uprooted to the northwest of the small shed. An old mobile home, that appeared to be abandoned, was destroyed 0.3 miles north of the intersection. Across the road from the mobile home, a sheet metal barn lost its walls, but the hay was still intact. A trailer was also pushed over on to a truck in this area.A shed and scattered tree limbs were downed 0.3 miles south of the intersection of Harrah Road and Northeast 150th Street. A half a mile east of Harrah Road a large tree limb, approximately one foot in diameter, was found snapped. On the county line, 0.15 miles north of the intersection of Pottawatomie Road and EW096 Road (NE 150th Street), several tree limbs were downed.This tornado created a path 7 miles long with F1 damage sustained in the area near the intersection of Dobbs Road and Memorial Road.",PDS

All meteorological severe weather forecast parameters came together over northeast Kansas on the afternoon of May 8 to produce an SPC ""high risk"" area of potential severe weather. The possibility of strong, long-lived destructive tornadoes was highlighted for nearly 24 hours in advance in nearly every NWS statement and product. The significant and widespread tornado outbreak in the nearby Kansas City area just four days before increased public weather awareness and concern, and together with timely watches, statements and warnings, helped prevent tornado related deaths and minimized storm injuries.",A tornado touched down in the southwest part of Lawrence and did considerable damage to the area.

One supercell produced three tornadoes that affected Moore, southern Oklahoma City, Midwest City, and Choctaw. A few locations in Moore and southeast Oklahoma City had also been hit by an F5 tornado that moved through the area on May 3, 1999. The General Motors Plant in southeast Oklahoma City sustained some of the most significant damage. This event was the second tornadic event of the day. Several tornadoes moved across south central Oklahoma during the early morning hours of May 8th (refer to appropriate data). This event was also the first of two days in a row where the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area was affected by tornadoes (refer to May 9, 2003 data). These thunderstorms developed near and along a strong dryline located across central Oklahoma.","This is the first segment of a tornado that began in Cleveland County and moved into Oklahoma County before dissipating 2.5 miles south-southeast of Choctaw. The tornado began in the area of Northwest 5th Street and Santa Fe Avenue in Moore, near the Church of Latter Day Saints. Damage intensities increased quickly to F2 and isolated F3 as the tornado, initially narrow, moved east along 5th street. Substantial structural damage in this initial touchdown area was confined to homes on the north side of 5th Street, just east of Santa Fe. Homes on the south side of 5th, and those on 6th Street one block to the north, were relatively undamaged.The damage track then widened quickly to nearly one-fifth of a mile as the tornado turned more to the northeast through residential areas, crossing Markwell Avenue between North 2nd and North 7th Streets. The most significant damage on Markwell, rated F2, was at North 6th Street. Continuing northeast and widening to nearly a quarter of a mile, the tornado crossed Janeway Avenue between Dillon Avenue (south edge) and 12th Street (north edge). Maximum damage on Janeway was to homes near 8th Street, and was rated F2.Damage intensity increased to F3 as the tornado approached 12th Street between Janeway and Interstate 35. A commercial building on the south side of 12th suffered F3 damage, as did several homes on the north side of 12th Street at City Avenue where several homes lost most of their outside walls. Maximum damage intensity on Sunrise Avenue (north of 12th and one block east of City Ave.) was rated strong F2 and consisted mostly of homes being partially or totally unroofed. Several vehicles were tossed into front yards, and in one case nearly into the front of a home.The worst damage produced within the city of Moore was as the tornado approached west sides of Interstate 35, just north of 12th Street. Damage in this area included major damage to two hotels, the First Christian Church, the Young Child Development Center, a Project Headstart building, an office building, and several restaurants. The church, child care center, and office building were leveled. The two hotels, both two-story, had their second floors partially or totally removed by the tornado. At least a half dozen vehicles were tossed in this area, with evidence suggesting that some of them may have traveled 100 yards or more. Had the leveled buildings here shown evidence of better construction, damage might have been rated F4. As it was, damage here was rated strong F3.A southbound moving Greyhound bus was hit by the tornado as it crossed Interstate 35. The bus was carrying twenty-three passengers, some of which chose to disembark to take cover in a ditch while others chose to stay on the bus. The bus rolled several times jostling passengers around the interior. Passengers were trapped between crushed seats and buckled walls while others were left hanging upside down and out broken windows. Of those that hid in the ditch, eleven were injured by flying debris. Eight passengers that stayed on the bus were also injured. Most of the injuries to the passengers were minor.The tornado crossed Interstate 35 0.25 to 0.50 miles north of 12th Street, damaging or destroying several businesses along Broadway, just east of the interstate. Intensity dropped to F2 in this area, but the path width remained close to a quarter of a mile. The tornado continued northeast across south and east parts of the Highland Park residential area, causing F1 and spotty F2 damage. The tornado weakened to F1 intensity and turned slightly to the north-northeast as it crossed Pole Road and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad tracks near and just south of Northeast 27th Street.It should be noted that the damage track of this tornado through Moore was nearly parallel to, and generally a quarter of a mile or less south of, the track of the F5 tornado that struck Moore on 3 May 1999. In fact, Highland Park also suffered extensive damage from the May 3rd tornado, but that damage was mainly in the north and west parts of the area. The damage track through Highland Park on 8 May 2003 was roughly two blocks farther south.The tornado crossed Northeast 27th between Pole Road and Eastern Avenue and continued northeast, crossing Eastern at the Lakeside Golf Course, just east of Eastern and straddling the Oklahoma City and Moore city limits. This golf course also took a direct hit from the tornado on 3 May 1999, and from this point northeastward for about one mile, the two tornado tracks overlapped. The tornado, at this point F1, continued northeast from the golf course into an open field just south of Southeast 89th Street, then struck the northwest part of a subdivision just south of 89th Street and west of Bryant Avenue. More than a dozen residences, including duplexes and single-family homes, were heavily damaged or destroyed in this area. The same northwest part of this subdivision was hit hard on 3 May 1999; many of the homes damaged or destroyed on 8 May had been rebuilt and were less than four years old.This tornado continued into Oklahoma County becoming an F4 and traveling a total of 17.3 miles.",PDS

Two injuries occurred in two of the three house trailers.  Numerous large trees were severed or downed by the tornado. The roof of a large machine shed on Black Lane was uplifted and displaced several hundred yards to the east.  The tornado then ripped through an auto salvage area where several vehicles were over-turned, damaged or destroyed.  The width of this damage area was 50 to 100 yards wide while damage intensity was rated F1. The tornado continued to travel just a bit south of due east causing damage to two homes and a camper and completely destroying another mobile home.

One supercell produced three tornadoes that affected Moore, southern Oklahoma City, Midwest City, and Choctaw. A few locations in Moore and southeast Oklahoma City had also been hit by an F5 tornado that moved through the area on May 3, 1999. The General Motors Plant in southeast Oklahoma City sustained some of the most significant damage. This event was the second tornadic event of the day. Several tornadoes moved across south central Oklahoma during the early morning hours of May 8th (refer to appropriate data). This event was also the first of two days in a row where the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area was affected by tornadoes (refer to May 9, 2003 data). These thunderstorms developed near and along a strong dryline located across central Oklahoma.","This is the final segment of a tornado that moved east-northeast from Cleveland County, 1.5 miles west-northwest of Moore, into Oklahoma County crossing the county line at Southeast 89th Street. The western edge of the damage path along SE 89th Street was about halfway between Eastern Avenue and Bryant Avenue and the eastern edge of the damage path was just east of Bryant Avenue. As the tornado approached Sunnylane Road, it produced significant damage to a manufacturing and distribution plant just west of Sunnylane along Southeast 85th Street. Six people were in the plant when the tornado struck, but were able to seek shelter in a safe room and nobody was injured at the plant. The manufacturing part of the complex was a large, free-span structure that was destroyed. The adjoining office part of the complex to the south was a brick structure that received significant damage to the exterior walls. To the east of the plant along the east side of Sunnylane Road, a car was flipped over. Between Sunnylane Road and Sooner Road, the tornado traveled through an open area narrowly missing a residential area. But as it crossed Sooner Road, it damaged or destroyed a number of businesses including a convenience store and a bank to the south of Interstate 240.The tornado continued east-northeast crossing Interstate 240 and Southeast 74th Street. Along SE 74th, a number of businesses received significant damage including a storage facility, a boat dealership, a Mary Kay Training Center, and a trucking company.Crossing Air Depot Boulevard, the tornado moved onto the property of the General Motors Corporation Assembly Plant causing significant (F4) damage to the plant. A newly built paint shop sustained the heaviest damage exposing equipment and new production parts to the weather. The body shop, power house, and a couple of cooling tanks also sustained significant damage. The stack of one of the boilers was also sheared off. More than 600 newly assembled sport utility vehicles parked outside the plant were damaged or destroyed. Approximately 100 employee vehicles were also damaged with one compact car being flipped vertically and wedged into the side of the paint shop. Two truck drivers making deliveries to the plant sustained minor injuries. However, the more than one thousand plant employees remained uninjured by moving to shelter well before the tornado struck. The nearby United Auto Workers Union headquarters was also heavily damaged in this area.The tornado moved into the southeast section of Tinker Air Force Base, including the south part of the runway complex. An ammunition storage bunker and a guard shack at the gate near Southeast 59th Street and Douglas Boulevard were heavily damaged. The guards and other personnel were able to seek shelter in an underground shelter. After crossing Douglas Boulevard, the tornado continued to slowly veer to the northeast and damaged homes along Berryman Road. The tornado continued to damage homes and downing trees and power lines. Strong F2 to F3 damage was observed on the west side of Post Road to the south of Southeast 44th Street.A number of homes were significantly damaged or destroyed in the north part of the Kennington neighborhood, which is located southeast of Southeast 44th Street and Post Road. Two homes in the north part of the neighborhood were completely destroyed consistent with F4 damage. One of these was a two story home with no roof or walls remaining. Two cars from the garage of a residence on the west side of Kennington Lane were found about 50 yards to the east. Another home farther east was destroyed, although walls remained intact. Other homes were severely damaged. The tornado continued across SE 44th Street and Interstate 40 and went into a residential area just west of Westminister Road. Homes were damaged on Newey Avenue, Randy Street, and Rowlett Avenue with the most significant damage near the intersection of Randy Street and Rowlett Avenue where house damage consistent with an F3 rating was observed. The tornado was likely a multiple-vortex tornado in this area as some of the damage in this area was inconsistent with a single cyclonic rotation.The tornado crossed Westminister Road and damaged more homes along Burning Oaks Drive. F3 damage occurred to a few homes along Burning Oaks Drive between Westminister and Twisted Oaks Drive. To the northeast, homes in another residential area on Southeast 32nd Street were significantly damaged and a number of large trees were also downed. Damage continued to the northeast crossing Anderson Road and Southeast 29th Street moving into the city of Midwest City. There were no known structures to hit as the tornado traveled northeast from near SE 29th and Anderson Road to Hiwassee Road. Significant tree damage was observed and one structure was damaged (F1) along Hiwassee Road just to the south of Southeast 15th Street. A large number of power poles and large trees were downed along SE 15th Street to the east of Hiwassee.To the north of Southeast 15th Street, the tornado moved into the ""Hidden Valley"" residential area of the city of Choctaw. The only known injury in Choctaw occurred where a woman suffered a broken leg as one home on Hidden Valley Lane was destroyed (F4). Two homes under construction were also destroyed. The tornado was narrower in this area. Other homes in the neighborhood were damaged along Willow Drive, Hummingbird Drive, and Kingbird Drive. In eastern portions of the neighborhood, significant tree damage continued, although there was no significant structural damage. The tornado turned more to the east-northeast again and crossed Henney Road and approached Choctaw Road near Southeast 10th Street where more homes were damaged. The tornado weakened as it moved east-northeast and dissipated southwest of Indian Meridian Road and Reno Avenue.This tornado carved a total path of 17.3 miles moving across the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area with the most significant damage (F4) occurring in Oklahoma County.",PDS

It continued to the Northeast for 15 miles...before the tornado itself touched down 1 mile west of the Kinzua Viaduct in a wooded area. The tornado continued northeast, producing a damage path 3 1/2 miles long, and about 1/3 mile wide. Winds were estimated at 100 mph, which classifies the tornado as an F1 on the Fujita scale. The tornado caused the collapse of the historic Kinzua Viaduct Bridge. Nine of the 20 bridge supports were destroyed...leading to the collapse of the  bridge. One employee of the Kinzua Bridge State Park was injured during the collaspe of the bridge. Thousands of trees were also downed along the path of the tornado.The Kinzua Bridge, constructed in 1882, was listed as one of Pennsylvania's 10 most endangered historic properties. The viaduct, at 301 feet high and 2053 feet long was the fourth largest in the nation. The bridge which once was capable of holding the 511 ton ""Big Boy"", the largest steam engine in the world, was closed to rail traffic in June of 2002 after inspection by the DCNR showed significant structural weakening.. Later, in August 2002, the bridge was closed to pedestrian traffic as well.  The Kinzua Bridge was in the midst of a 10.8 million dollar restoration project which began in February 2003.The tornado then lifted up about 2 1/2 miles northeast of the bridge. Downburst wind damage continued to about 2 miles north of Smethport, where the tornado once again touched down. The tornado continued on a north-northeast path until it lifted again about 1 mile north of Farmers Valley, near the intersections of routes 46 and 446. Top wind speeds during the second touchdown were estimated at 80 to 90 mph, again classifying the storm as an F1 in intensity. The path of the second touchdown was about 3 miles long, with a width of about 150 yards.This second touchdown damaged 2 barns...and destroyed a third. Two homes and a church were also damaged. No injuries or deaths were reported.On August 6th, Governor Edward G.

As Claudette passed the Yucatan Channel and entered the Gulf of Mexico on Friday July 12th, the steering currents relaxed and she slowed her northwesterly movement. Claudette produced tropical storm force winds and heavy rains primarily on her eastern quadrant, which spanned a large portion of the central Gulf and produced wave heights up to 15 feet.  As early as Sunday July 13th large swells were reaching the sand dunes on Padre Island.  Claudette wobbled slowly toward the middle Texas coast in very weak steering currents.  The upper level shear in this system relaxed as expected providing the environment for Claudette to strengthen into a Hurricane. Claudette made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir/Simpson Scale near Port O'Connor, Texas (Calhoun County) on Tuesday July 15th around 1030 am.  Just prior to landfall storm surge was 5 feet at Port O'Connor in combination with high astronomical tides.  Wind speeds along the Northern Coastal Bend were generally sustained around 65 mph at landfall with gusts to 80 mph.  Maximum sustained winds at the time of landfall were estimated by the National Hurricane Center at 90 mph.  The Formosa Plant in Point Comfort recorded maximum sustained winds of 80 mph with a gust to 100 mph.  The minimum central pressure of Claudette at the time of landfall was 981 MB (28.37 Inches).  Claudette produced a brief tornado in Port Lavaca.  Damage was not attributed directly to this tornado, rather to the hurricane winds.Claudette continued inland during the afternoon of the 15th across Victoria, Goliad and Bee counties weakening to a Tropical Storm.  Claudette continued moving west across Live Oak, McMullen and La Salle counties during the evening and into EWX CWA.  Claudette continued into Northwestern Mexico and into the Big Bend of Texas before dissipating on July 17th.Damages for all of Texas at the time of this writing stood at 45.7 million dollars in uninsured losses and 90.0 million in insured losses.  These losses do not include crop damage, which were still pending at the time of this writing.  In the State of Texas two indirect fatalities were also attributed to Claudette and six indirect injuries.  One of the indirect fatalities occurred in the CRP CWA in Victoria when a woman was killed by a falling tree limb while surveying damage to her house.  Over twenty thousand homes received damage across the CRP County Warning Area, most of which was classified as minor damage in Victoria County.  Over six hundred homes received major damage, again most of which occurred in Victoria County.  Over sixty homes were completely destroyed, mostly in Calhoun County.The heaviest rainfall with Claudette fell across Bee, Goliad and Refugio Counties.  Widespread 4 to 6 inch amounts were estimated across these counties by CRP WSR-88D.  Elsewhere along the path of Claudette totals ranged from 2 to 5 inches.  Further south in CRP southern CWA totals remained under 1 inch expect for a thin band of 4 to 6 inch amounts stretching from the Padre Island National Seashore north into Refugio County.",Brief tornado touchdown associated with Hurricane Claudette.  NWS Post Storm Survey Team concluded no direct damage associated with tornado.  All damage around the area was associated with Hurricane Force winds from Claudette.,PDS

The grader was swept off a bridge by the raging flood waters.  The two men sat on a wheel of the grader until 6 am before the water receded enough to rescue them safely.  No one was home in the house the men were trying to reach, but it was destroyed by the fire.  The flooding caused severe county road and bridge damage in eastern Jewell county.  The highway in the Formoso area was flooded for a time.  Later that night, tornadoes were reported by both law enforcement and the public in Smith and Phillips counties.  Given the tornadoes occurred in very rural areas, no damage was reported.","The same law enforcement officer saw another brief tornado along Highway 8 northwest of Reamsville.  Again, no damage was reported.",PDS

A rain-wrapped tornado was sighted in western Valley county shortly after 7:30 pm by several storm chasers.  The tornado blasted 2 farmsteads, one of which was abandoned.  A total of 14 outbuildings were damaged or destroyed.  The tornado was in the far western part of Valley county along the Comstock road.  Another brief tornado was reported near Arcadia a short time later but no damage was confirmed.Elsewhere, vicious high winds over 70 mph did extensive damage north of Shelby in eastern Polk county.  Several farmsteads sustained house, outbuilding, grain bin and tree damage.  In one case, a garage was nearly ripped from the house it was attached to.  Twenty four center pivot irrigation systems were severely damaged or destroyed.  A semi-tractor trailer was overturned as the high winds approached.  The driver was unhurt but a passenger sustained minor injuries and was treated at a nearby hospital.  At one point, 4,500 customers were without power in the area.  The high winds also pounded the Palmer area about an hour earlier that night.  On a farm north of Palmer, a roof was torn from a metal building, a garage destroyed and a large goose neck trailer tossed several feet by the wind.  The damage was strewn across a nearby corn field.Finally, hail caused crop and property damage in parts of the area.  The St. Libory area sustained the worst damage with hail stones the size of baseballs and larger were reported.  Siding and windows were heavily damaged on many homes, especially just north of town.  Crop damage was fairly extensive along a narrow path in the same area.",A brief tornado was reported just west of Arcadia. No damage was reported.,PDS

One storm near Aurora produced very large hail.  One stone measured by an NWS Storm Survey team was determined to be the largest sized stone to fall in the United States.  It measured 7 inches in diameter and 18.75 inches in circumference.  Many other large stones were noted on the northern side of Aurora.  Given the lack of wind, damage was limited to roofs, a few windows and some crop land near town.  The storm also produced a couple of brief small tornadoes as it slowly moved through northern Hamilton county.At nearly the same time, another very slow moving storm produced several tornadoes, hail and extremely heavy rains in Thayer county. One tornado moved through the town of Deshler going from the southeast side of town to the west.  One man was killed in his garage before he was able to get to shelter.  Over 400 homes in Deshler were damaged with four being completely demolished.  Nearly 100 homes were moderately to severely damaged.  Six businesses in town were considered a complete loss and 25 others reportedly suffered moderate to severe damage.  Seven people were injured, most were minor and were from broken glass.  Later in the evening, a tornado was reported north of Bradshaw in York county.  Storm spotters about 1 mile west of the tornado saw debris being flung through the air.  A farmstead was hit with most of the damage done to an old barn.Despite ongoing drought conditions, widespread flooding was reported in Thayer and southern Fillmore counties.  The flash flood along the Rose Creek at Hubbell provided some of the worst damage.  Water was flowing into houses and businesses on main street to the tune of up to 5 feet deep.  Boats were the only mode of travel through the business district.  Up to 15 residents had to be evacuated by the local Dive and Rescue team using jet skis.  The flooding was caused by extremely heavy rainfall in nearby Republic County, Kansas.Flooding and flash flooding was also a problem throughout Thayer county.  Rainfall of over 12 inches was reported about 5 miles north of Deshler.  Residents reported nearly 5 hours of constant, wind-driven rain.  Windows were blown out and the rain just poured into homes.  Widespread agricultural damage was done due to the rain.  The runoff in the Snake and Spring creeks ravaged Deshler, the town which had already been hammered by tornadoes that evening.  Flooding was concentrated in the southern part of town and most widespread near the park and fairgrounds.Major river flooding was reported along the Little Blue River from just west of Hebron to the Jefferson county line.  One man at his farmstead near Gilead had to be air lifted to safety by the National Guard as flooding waters rose on his property.  Dozens of county roads and bridges were damaged or destroyed.  U. S. Highway 81 was restricted to one lane travel at Hebron due to the high water on the road.  Portions of Highways 81, 136 and 9 were closed for a time due to high water.  The Big Sandy Creek flowed out of its banks at Alexandria and crested at 14.5 feet.  Water was flowing over the highway near town and filling back into the town's sewer drains.  In all, several million dollars in damage was done by the flooding alone.  Some locals said this was the worst flooding in the area in 55 years.",A brief tornado in western York county.,PDS

One produced a tornado that moved through Fauquier County, and the other produced high winds that downed trees and power lines across the western suburbs of Washington D.C. In Fauquier County, an F0 tornado touched down 3 miles west of Warrenton. It lifted up and down along a 5 mile path before finally dissipating 2 miles southeast of town.  The first location where damage was found was in the vicinity of Waterloo Estates.  A large tree several feet in diameter was downed on Stonelea Lane.  A three-quarter-mile long path of downed trees up to 50 yards wide was surveyed between Stonelea Lane and Fauquier High School.  The tornado lifted as it pushed over the high school, but not before damaging a flag pole and athletic field equipment on school grounds. Several people at the high school saw the funnel and took shelter inside the building. The next touchdown was on Culpeper Street, just south of the center of town.  Several tree branches were downed there. The tornado lifted off the ground again, but touched down briefly southeast of town near the intersection of Route 643 (Meetze Road) and Poplar Grove Drive.  One final touchdown was observed near the intersection of Route 674 (Lunsford Road) and Route 670 (Auburn Road).  Both touchdown locations southeast of town had minor tree damage.  It is possible that the tornado touched down one more time in the community of Cassanova, about 5 miles southeast of Warrenton. Minor damage was reported at the intersection of Route 602 and 616, but the damage was cleaned up before it could be surveyed.  A funnel cloud was spotted two more times with this storm, once near Brent Town in southeast Fauquier County and finally at Quantico in Prince William County.  High winds were also produced by the thunderstorm just north and south of the tornado's path.  Trees were downed in two locations along Route 802 (Springs Road) about 2 miles southwest of Warrenton.  A microburst of wind up to 70 MPH downed several large trees in a small area of eastern Warrenton between Alexandria Pike and Walker Drive.  Leaves and twigs were plastered to buildings and siding was damaged in this area as well.  This thunderstorm also produced very heavy downpours and pea sized hail over Warrenton.  Street and basement flooding was reported as the storm moved through.  Small hail and heavy downpours were also reported in Opal.Another thunderstorm produced high winds across the Virginia suburbs of D.C.  In Falls Church, a power line was downed onto a moving pickup truck on Westmoreland Drive. Two people were trapped inside the vehicle until firefighters could cut off electricity to the wires.  In Fairfax County, power lines were downed onto Woodland Drive in Tyson's Corner. Trees were downed in Vienna.  Cloud to ground lightning started a house fire northeast of Mount Vernon and blew transformers in Merrifield and Herndon. In the city of Fairfax, a townhouse and a house both caught fire after being struck by lightning.  Scattered trees were downed as well, including one which fell on a car at the intersection of Arlington Boulevard and Dale Road. A wind gust of 46 MPH was recorded in Reston.

At the surface, a deep low pressure area moved across the eastern Great Lakes, driving a warm front across eastern New York and adjacent New England. The air became very unstable in the warm air mass behind the front. The combination of the unstable air and strong wind shear aloft, produced the most significant severe outbreak of the season across the region, and the largest tornado outbreak since May 31, 1998.   	The first line of thunderstorms worked across the region during the afternoon hours. These produced spotty wind damage, mainly downed trees and wires across portions of Albany, Greene, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga and Schoharie Counties. Torrential rains falling in a very short interval of time caused flash flooding in the city of Schenectady. North Jay Street suddenly flooded and a woman had to be rescued from her car as it became submerged in about three feet of moving water. 	An even stronger line of storms moved east from central New York, into eastern New York during the evening hours. This squall line produced wind damage of its own, with spotty downed trees and wires across portions of Albany and Washington counties. Wind damage was more concentrated in Ulster and Dutchess counties. In Saugherties, Ulster County, downed trees flattened three cars. In Dutchess County, a large swath of trees were downed in the town of East Fishkill and in the town of Tivoli, a state of emergency was declared.    	One cell broke loose from the line, and became a supercell as it reached the Mid Hudson Valley. This storm ultimately spawned a long lived significant tornado. The twister initially touched down in southeastern Greene County, and produced a  discontinous path of 17 miles in Greene County, 12.2 miles in northwestern Columbia County and 4.8 miles in southern Rensselaer County.  The tornada left a swath of destruction including hundreds, if not thousands of trees uprooted and snapped away, along with lots of power and telephone wires. Many roads in each of these counties were impassable due to debris. 	The first confirmed touchdown was in the town of Palenville, Greene County. The tornado was ranked as F1 with a 50 yard wide path and on the ground for a half mile. An unoccupied home had its siding ripped off. Several other homes were severely damaged including a trailor. The tornado next touched downed in the hamlet of Kiskatom, in the town of Catskill, where it increased to F2 intensity and cut a path 150 yards wide and over a mile long. Several homes were destroyed along with seven injuries right off Route 32 in the Brookside Camp Grounds.  Four people were trapped inside one of the trailer homes. Another lady was trapped inside a mobile home as it was lifted into the air then smashed into the ground. The woman was badly bruised but survived the ordeal. The next touchdown was in Athens with a rating of F0, and the last touchdown in Greene County was in Coaxsackie where a manufactured home was hoisted off its foundation, and had insulation pasted to the siding on the downwind side, which is typical of F1 damage.  	The tornado ripped across Columbia County with two touchdowns confirmed in the towns of Kinderhook, the Newtown Hook section in the town of Stuyvesant and the town of Niverville. The touchdown at Kinderhook Lake the strongest, with a ranking of F2. A barn was completely destroyed and the unfortunate farmer stated that some of his haywagons ended up in Kinderhook Lake. A garage was completely leveled and a car was tossed onto the tops of a blown-down tree. Another building had its metal roof partially peeled back. In Niverville, 11 people were given shelter as they were afraid to stay in their damaged homes. Straight-line thunderstorms produced additional tree and wire damage in the towns of Chatham, Hudson and Valatia. A state of emergency was declared throughout Columbia County. There was one injury reported by the newspaper in that county. The only hail reported with these storm took place in Stockpart, where golf ball size stones where reported. A state of emergency was declared in all of Columbia County right after the tornado past on by. 	The supercell and resultant tornado next touched down in the town of Nassua in Rensselaer County, near Route 20 with a rating of F1. The average width of the twister was between 75 and 100 yards and a discontinous path length of more than four miles. More homes and a garage were severly damaged but no injuries were reported. The roof on the Agway was blown off and a gazebo landed across the state highway in a  pile of splintered wood. The NWS Survey team noted that the twister had multiple vortices in this area.  Additional straight line damage was also noted in the same town. The last touchdowns were in the town of Schaghticoke with an F1 rating.

At the surface, a deep low pressure area moved across the eastern Great Lakes, driving a warm front across eastern New York and adjacent New England. The air became very unstable in the warm air mass behind the front. The combination of the unstable air and strong wind shear aloft, produced the most significant severe outbreak of the season across the region, and the largest tornado outbreak since May 31, 1998.   	The first line of thunderstorms worked across the region during the afternoon hours. These produced spotty wind damage, mainly downed trees and wires across portions of Albany, Greene, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga and Schoharie Counties. Torrential rains falling in a very short interval of time caused flash flooding in the city of Schenectady. North Jay Street suddenly flooded and a woman had to be rescued from her car as it became submerged in about three feet of moving water. 	An even stronger line of storms moved east from central New York, into eastern New York during the evening hours. This squall line produced wind damage of its own, with spotty downed trees and wires across portions of Albany and Washington counties. Wind damage was more concentrated in Ulster and Dutchess counties. In Saugherties, Ulster County, downed trees flattened three cars. In Dutchess County, a large swath of trees were downed in the town of East Fishkill and in the town of Tivoli, a state of emergency was declared.    	One cell broke loose from the line, and became a supercell as it reached the Mid Hudson Valley. This storm ultimately spawned a long lived significant tornado. The twister initially touched down in southeastern Greene County, and produced a  discontinous path of 17 miles in Greene County, 12.2 miles in northwestern Columbia County and 4.8 miles in southern Rensselaer County.  The tornada left a swath of destruction including hundreds, if not thousands of trees uprooted and snapped away, along with lots of power and telephone wires. Many roads in each of these counties were impassable due to debris. 	The first confirmed touchdown was in the town of Palenville, Greene County. The tornado was ranked as F1 with a 50 yard wide path and on the ground for a half mile. An unoccupied home had its siding ripped off. Several other homes were severely damaged including a trailor. The tornado next touched downed in the hamlet of Kiskatom, in the town of Catskill, where it increased to F2 intensity and cut a path 150 yards wide and over a mile long. Several homes were destroyed along with seven injuries right off Route 32 in the Brookside Camp Grounds.  Four people were trapped inside one of the trailer homes. Another lady was trapped inside a mobile home as it was lifted into the air then smashed into the ground. The woman was badly bruised but survived the ordeal. The next touchdown was in Athens with a rating of F0, and the last touchdown in Greene County was in Coaxsackie where a manufactured home was hoisted off its foundation, and had insulation pasted to the siding on the downwind side, which is typical of F1 damage.  	The tornado ripped across Columbia County with two touchdowns confirmed in the towns of Kinderhook, the Newtown Hook section in the town of Stuyvesant and the town of Niverville. The touchdown at Kinderhook Lake the strongest, with a ranking of F2. A barn was completely destroyed and the unfortunate farmer stated that some of his haywagons ended up in Kinderhook Lake. A garage was completely leveled and a car was tossed onto the tops of a blown-down tree. Another building had its metal roof partially peeled back. In Niverville, 11 people were given shelter as they were afraid to stay in their damaged homes. Straight-line thunderstorms produced additional tree and wire damage in the towns of Chatham, Hudson and Valatia. A state of emergency was declared throughout Columbia County. There was one injury reported by the newspaper in that county. The only hail reported with these storm took place in Stockpart, where golf ball size stones where reported. A state of emergency was declared in all of Columbia County right after the tornado past on by. 	The supercell and resultant tornado next touched down in the town of Nassua in Rensselaer County, near Route 20 with a rating of F1. The average width of the twister was between 75 and 100 yards and a discontinous path length of more than four miles. More homes and a garage were severly damaged but no injuries were reported. The roof on the Agway was blown off and a gazebo landed across the state highway in a  pile of splintered wood. The NWS Survey team noted that the twister had multiple vortices in this area.  Additional straight line damage was also noted in the same town. The last touchdowns were in the town of Schaghticoke with an F1 rating.

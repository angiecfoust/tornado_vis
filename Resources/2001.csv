The cold front from the previous storm did not move all that far to the south of Iowa.  As a result, warm and moist air was able to move north into Iowa rapidly.  A warm front lifted into southern Iowa during the late afternoon hours, sending temperatures into the 80s over parts of southern Iowa.  Dew point temperatures jumped into the low to mid 60s.  The atmosphere became very unstable with thunderstorms developing along the front.  Most of the storms were associated with the warm front itself,  though  a mesoscale feature moved along the front setting the stage for an additional like of thunderstorms that developed north to south in south central Iowa.  The main feature with the storms was hail.  There were numerous reports of hail ranging from nickel size up to golf ball size.  Several of the storms had well developed meso circulations associated with them.  A few tornadoes resulted.  Two of the tornadoes were very small and only touched down briefly in Tama and Dallas Counties.  The other tornadoes were stronger.  One tornado touched down in Decatur County near Leon.  Two people were injured, one requiring hospitalization, as a mobile home was overturned by the gust front ahead of the storm itself.  The second of the stronger tornadoes moved through Adams County.  A trailer house was overturned and the roofs were removed from two sheds on a farm northeast of Mt. Etna.  Thunderstorms produced very heavy rainfall of one to two inches per hour over Ringgold County.  Total rainfall approached 4 inches in less than 3 hours as storms repeatedly moved across the same areas.  The rain caused flash flooding in the county.  In one instance, Lotts Creek overtopped a road southeast of Mt. Ayr, causing nearly $50,000 in damage as the road washed out.   As the storms moved through Decatur County, lightning stuck a house in Garde Grove.  The house was set on fire, but it was not detected for several hours after the lightning strike.

The most notable tornado formed across Coal County in Oklahoma and resulted in one fatality and one injury as it destroyed a mobile home.  In addition to damage produced by severe thunderstorms, sustained winds of 40 to 50 mph with gusts as high as 73 mph developed just ahead of the most frequent period of severe weather and persisted for several hours. In Tillman County, at 2330 CST on the 10th, a barn roof was damaged 3 miles east of Frederick. A barn roof was blown off, and a fence was downed 4 miles east of Frederick, and a house roof sustained minor damage 4 miles north of Frederick. Trees and power lines were downed in Ponca City in Kay County, while in Garfield County, minor but widespread damage, was sustained to trees, power poles, and numerous other structures.","This tornado developed in Cooke County Texas at approximately 0257 CST and tracked northeastward for approximately 1 mile before crossing the Red River into Love County in Oklahoma (see National Weather Service Forth Worth, Texas stormdata for more information on the beginning portion of this tornado in Texas). In Oklahoma the most significant damage, rated F1, occurred 3 miles southeast of Thackerville where a barn was destroyed, and a mobile home was severely damaged with debris scattered for 2 miles.Note to all users: This is a greatly simplified version of the tornado path. The tornado actually crossed the state border 6 times, continuing almost due northeastward from the end point listed in this entry. The true end point is 10 miles east-southeast of Marietta, Oklahoma at 0315 CST, resulting in a total path length across Texas and Oklahoma of approximately 18 miles, with most of the damage consisting of only tree damage for the last 10 miles.",PDS

Another ""Double Wide"" manufactured home, just west of the one that was destroyed, was picked up in the air,  blown across or through a clump of trees, and set down about 50 yards south of where it was tied down, in another clump of trees.  When viewing the home from a distance it appeared to have been purposely placed in the trees, with little outside damage visible.  However, when viewed form the inside, it looked as if an earthquake had hit it, with almost everything inside damaged.  Both of these manufactured homes were fairly new.  Both of the homes had the front tie downs pulled out of the ground and the anchors on the back of the homes snapped. The winds were estimated to be greater than 100 mph with the combination of the tornado and the intense downdraft from the ""Bow Echo"".

Despite the late hour of the day, cooler temperatures and foggy conditions, these thunderstorms began to rotate and produced several tornadoes across the area.  The first tornado developed in southwest Rooks county near Palco and lifted just south of Webster Lake.  One farmstead was hit with damage sustained to outbuildings, trees and farm equipment.  The next twister entered Rooks county from Ellis county south of Plainville.  This tornado hit a farmstead on the south side of Plainville and traveled northeast through the cemetery and then on to rural areas of eastern Rooks county.  The farmstead sustained damage to outbuildings and trees.  The home was spared from major damage.  Another weak tornado started on the south side of Plainville and traveled up US highway 183 and then northeast to a modular home manufacturing plant.  Several homes in production were damaged.  Other homes along the path had roof or window damage.  Three other tornadoes occurred in Osborne county.  The first, on the west side of the county, damaged outbuildings and trees along its 9 mile path.  A short lived tornado near the junction of US highway 24 and Kansas Highway 181 hit an abandoned gas station.  Old tanks and concrete blocks were littered about for nearly a mile to the northeast.  The last tornado in the county started southwest of Downs and traveled northeast.  It hit one farmstead on the west side of Downs causing damage to various outbuildings and farm machinery.  This twister continued northeast and entered extreme southeast Smith county and then into southwest Jewell county.  Before lifting, the tornado hit the parsonage of the Dispatch church, causing roof and wall damage to the home.  Other weak tornadoes were noted in Smith and Jewell counties with minor damage noted to power poles and trees.  Some other reports indicated that some hail and strong winds accompanied these storms.",,PDS

Intense surface low pressure formed over western Kansas with a central pressure by sunrise on the 11th of 977 Mb.  The weather situation was very dynamic with 500 Mb winds over 100 kts and a very sharp dry punch clearly visible on the satellite pictures.  During the day the warm front that extended east from the low reached into southern Iowa, then extended eastward.  There were two things that occurred during the day.  The first was a very strong supercell that formed over northern Missouri during the morning.  This storm lifted north-northeast at about 50 kts into Iowa, producing a long track tornado with a path extending nearly all the way to Des Moines.  During the afternoon the warm front surged north with the northeast progression of the surface dry line.  Dew points rose into the mid 60s to the south of the warm front across much of the southeast half to two thirds of Iowa.  Surface temperatures in these areas reached the 60s north, with 70s south.  With the atmosphere primed, the dry line began to move into Iowa.  Dew point temperatures behind the dry line were in the 30s with southwest winds of 30 to 50 MPH.  A broken squall line formed on the nose of the dry punch and became severe quickly.  The storm cells themselves were not all that large, but nearly every cell along the line did carry a mesoscale circulation.  There were several tornado touchdowns as the line lifted north as well.  The primary severe weather during this even was the tornadic nature of it.  There were reports of wind and hail, but everything considered these reports were pretty scattered.  There were very few reports of wind and hail with the first supercell as it lifted north out of Missouri.  One inch diameter hail was reported in Ringgold County east of Redding.  Reports of winds and hail were more frequent with the second line of thunderstorms.  There were numerous reports of hail up to marble size with this line, however there were not all that many reports of hail larger than that.  A few reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail were received from Marion and Polk Counties.  The most significant hail occurred in northeast Iowa in Butler County.  Golf ball size hail fell in the town of Parkersburg as the line passed over the city.  There were more reports of wind with the second round.  Nearly all locations reported winds of at least 50 MPH as the line passed overhead.  Scattered reports of winds of 70 to 85 MPH were received.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County as high winds downed power lines and downed outbuildings north of Ogden.  The greatest wind damage occurred over northeast Iowa in Black Hawk and Franklin Counties.  A building was blown off of its foundation and onto an adjacent road southwest of Hampton in Franklin County.  A roof of a barn was damaged and a grain wagon was tipped over northwest of Hampton.  Roof and house damage was reported over parts of Black Hawk County as well.  Five injuries occurred in Warren County at Carlisle when winds of around 65 MPH toppled a school bus.  Twenty one children were on board the bus when it overturned with 5 treated for minor injuries.  Spotty damage was reported around the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.   Several tornadoes occurred with this system.  The most significant tornado entered southern Iowa around mid day.  This  tornado reached minimal F3 intensity just east of Mt. Ayr (Ringgold County).  Property damage is estimated at over $500,000 in Ringgold county alone. Across the Des Moines area of responsibility, at least 15 homes were destroyed, and 60 residences were damaged as around a dozen tornadoes touched down.  A supercell thunderstorm moved north from Missouri into southern Iowa late in the morning of April 11.  The storm produced a tornado in northern Missouri and crossed into Iowa in Ringgold County. The storm, and tornado, moved north through Ringgold County with a continuous damage path half way through the county.   The damage path continued north through northern Ringgold County, southeast Union County and into northwest Clarke County.  In this area, the path was not continuous.  Based on damage reports, the tornado continued to produce occasional damage in Madison County.  Chaser reports indicate the tornado had a multi-vortex structure as it moved through Ringgold and Union Counties.  The last reported sighting was in northern Polk County where a brief touchdown was reported with no damage.  The storm likely produced one tornado from the Missouri border to Madison County with an intermittent damage track.   Damage in Ringgold County was severe with initial estimates around $1 million.  The county was later declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.  A second tornado briefly touched down in northern Polk County.  The touchdown in Polk County was indeed a separate tornado.  Even though the tornado was from the same parent cell, the system had occluded and was in the process of forming a new tornado as it passed over the western part of the Des Moines area.  Reports from this tornado indicate that at least 9 homes were damaged or destroyed, one business destroyed, and a school building damaged.  In addition to losses to homes, one farmstead was hit with considerable damage and some livestock damage.  A series of tornadoes formed on the heels of the supercell tornado as the dry line pushed into the state.  Most of these were brief touchdowns, however the storms were moving around 60 MPH.  Three tornadoes touched down in Boone County.  The most significant tornado touched down north of Ogden.  It produced a 3 mile long track up to 1/8 mile wide.  Farm site hit along highway P70.  Barn and grain bins destroyed, knocking out windows in house. Otherwise only minor damage to house. Debris scattered 1 mile to next farm site where there was minor damage to many buildings. Track continued north-northeast across highway E26 into the campground at Don Williams Lake. A storage building was destroyed, several trees downed, plus outhouses, picnic tables and signs were damaged. The damage track dissipated on the northeast side of the Don Williams Recreation Area.  There were several brief touchdowns with relatively minor damage in Guthrie, Greene, and Hamilton Counties.  A stronger tornado touched down in southeast Black Hawk County, causing significant damage to two homes in the La Porte City area.  The most serious tornado in terms of loss of life occurred in Wapello County.  A tornado developed in rural southern Wapello County, a mile southwest of Agency, Iowa, around 1600 CDT, on Wednesday, April 11.  The tornado path was 50 to 100 yards wide with sporadic touchdowns toward the north-northeast for the next 6 miles.    Survey responses indicated that the duration of impact at any one location was only 15 to 30 seconds as the tornado quickly moved through Agency and over farms at a 60 mph horizontal movement.   The Odd Fellows Lodge in Agency was destroyed, and over 50 residences were damaged.  Two women inside were killed, three people injured and three people had no injuries.  As the storm moved through Agency, a garage was lifted and carried about 100 meters off of its foundation.  The car inside was twisted and covered with debris.  In another incident, one house was hit by the tornado causing damage to the house.  The family dog was in the dog pen at the time.  The tornado lifted the pen and twirled it through the air.  The dog pen was deposited some distance downstream and what was truly amazing was the fact that the dog was uninjured.  Following the tornado, U.S. Highway 34 was closed for 2 hours in order to removed debris from the highway. Governor Tom Vilsack visited the area during a storm survey.  The governor spoke with Brenda Brock of the  National Weather Service, Ellen Gordon, Administrator, Iowa Emergency Management Division, emergency management personnel (fire department, law enforcement, mayor) and the public.

There were numerous reports of hail up to marble size with this line, however there were not all that many reports of hail larger than that.  A few reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail were received from Marion and Polk Counties.  The most significant hail occurred in northeast Iowa in Butler County.  Golf ball size hail fell in the town of Parkersburg as the line passed over the city.  There were more reports of wind with the second round.  Nearly all locations reported winds of at least 50 MPH as the line passed overhead.  Scattered reports of winds of 70 to 85 MPH were received.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County as high winds downed power lines and downed outbuildings north of Ogden.  The greatest wind damage occurred over northeast Iowa in Black Hawk and Franklin Counties.  A building was blown off of its foundation and onto an adjacent road southwest of Hampton in Franklin County.  A roof of a barn was damaged and a grain wagon was tipped over northwest of Hampton.  Roof and house damage was reported over parts of Black Hawk County as well.  Five injuries occurred in Warren County at Carlisle when winds of around 65 MPH toppled a school bus.  Twenty one children were on board the bus when it overturned with 5 treated for minor injuries.  Spotty damage was reported around the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.   Several tornadoes occurred with this system.  The most significant tornado entered southern Iowa around mid day.  This  tornado reached minimal F3 intensity just east of Mt. Ayr (Ringgold County).  Property damage is estimated at over $500,000 in Ringgold county alone. Across the Des Moines area of responsibility, at least 15 homes were destroyed, and 60 residences were damaged as around a dozen tornadoes touched down.  A supercell thunderstorm moved north from Missouri into southern Iowa late in the morning of April 11.  The storm produced a tornado in northern Missouri and crossed into Iowa in Ringgold County. The storm, and tornado, moved north through Ringgold County with a continuous damage path half way through the county.   The damage path continued north through northern Ringgold County, southeast Union County and into northwest Clarke County.  In this area, the path was not continuous.  Based on damage reports, the tornado continued to produce occasional damage in Madison County.  Chaser reports indicate the tornado had a multi-vortex structure as it moved through Ringgold and Union Counties.  The last reported sighting was in northern Polk County where a brief touchdown was reported with no damage.  The storm likely produced one tornado from the Missouri border to Madison County with an intermittent damage track.   Damage in Ringgold County was severe with initial estimates around $1 million.  The county was later declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.  A second tornado briefly touched down in northern Polk County.  The touchdown in Polk County was indeed a separate tornado.  Even though the tornado was from the same parent cell, the system had occluded and was in the process of forming a new tornado as it passed over the western part of the Des Moines area.  Reports from this tornado indicate that at least 9 homes were damaged or destroyed, one business destroyed, and a school building damaged.  In addition to losses to homes, one farmstead was hit with considerable damage and some livestock damage.  A series of tornadoes formed on the heels of the supercell tornado as the dry line pushed into the state.  Most of these were brief touchdowns, however the storms were moving around 60 MPH.  Three tornadoes touched down in Boone County.  The most significant tornado touched down north of Ogden.  It produced a 3 mile long track up to 1/8 mile wide.  Farm site hit along highway P70.  Barn and grain bins destroyed, knocking out windows in house. Otherwise only minor damage to house. Debris scattered 1 mile to next farm site where there was minor damage to many buildings. Track continued north-northeast across highway E26 into the campground at Don Williams Lake. A storage building was destroyed, several trees downed, plus outhouses, picnic tables and signs were damaged. The damage track dissipated on the northeast side of the Don Williams Recreation Area.  There were several brief touchdowns with relatively minor damage in Guthrie, Greene, and Hamilton Counties.  A stronger tornado touched down in southeast Black Hawk County, causing significant damage to two homes in the La Porte City area.  The most serious tornado in terms of loss of life occurred in Wapello County.  A tornado developed in rural southern Wapello County, a mile southwest of Agency, Iowa, around 1600 CDT, on Wednesday, April 11.  The tornado path was 50 to 100 yards wide with sporadic touchdowns toward the north-northeast for the next 6 miles.    Survey responses indicated that the duration of impact at any one location was only 15 to 30 seconds as the tornado quickly moved through Agency and over farms at a 60 mph horizontal movement.   The Odd Fellows Lodge in Agency was destroyed, and over 50 residences were damaged.  Two women inside were killed, three people injured and three people had no injuries.  As the storm moved through Agency, a garage was lifted and carried about 100 meters off of its foundation.  The car inside was twisted and covered with debris.  In another incident, one house was hit by the tornado causing damage to the house.  The family dog was in the dog pen at the time.  The tornado lifted the pen and twirled it through the air.  The dog pen was deposited some distance downstream and what was truly amazing was the fact that the dog was uninjured.  Following the tornado, U.S. Highway 34 was closed for 2 hours in order to removed debris from the highway. Governor Tom Vilsack visited the area during a storm survey.  The governor spoke with Brenda Brock of the  National Weather Service, Ellen Gordon, Administrator, Iowa Emergency Management Division, emergency management personnel (fire department, law enforcement, mayor) and the public.

The next tornado touched down about two miles east of Columbia and traveled six miles to a point seven miles eastnortheast of Columbia. The next tornado touched down nine miles eastnortheast of Columbia and traveled into Lamar County to a point four miles northeast of Oak Grove. The final tornado produced by the supercell in the Jackson NWS County Warning Area touched down in the northwest part of the city of Hattiesburg and traveled across northern sections of Hattiesburg and then across the city of Petal. This tornado lifted about two miles east of Petal. Damage reports in Marion County are somewhat difficult to estimate because an earlier tornado affected portions of the county, and the severe thunderstorm that produced the first tornado in the county caused damage in the city of Columbia before the second tornadic storm moved into the county. Damage to homes in Marion County from the tornado is estimated at $700,000 with other damage in the county listed under separate storms. The total damage from the tornado in Lamar County is estimated to have been around $4.5 million. In Lamar County, the tornado destroyed five houses, 24 mobile homes, one business, and 17 farms. The tornado caused major damage to 33 houses, 30 mobile homes, one church, two businesses, and seven farms. Minor damage occurred to approximately 30 mobile homes, eight  apartment units, one church, two businesses, and a farm. The total damage from the tornado in Forrest County was estimated to be around $6 million. In Forrest County, the tornado tracked through populated areas of Hattiesburg and Petal.

Intense surface low pressure formed over western Kansas with a central pressure by sunrise on the 11th of 977 Mb.  The weather situation was very dynamic with 500 Mb winds over 100 kts and a very sharp dry punch clearly visible on the satellite pictures.  During the day the warm front that extended east from the low reached into southern Iowa, then extended eastward.  There were two things that occurred during the day.  The first was a very strong supercell that formed over northern Missouri during the morning.  This storm lifted north-northeast at about 50 kts into Iowa, producing a long track tornado with a path extending nearly all the way to Des Moines.  During the afternoon the warm front surged north with the northeast progression of the surface dry line.  Dew points rose into the mid 60s to the south of the warm front across much of the southeast half to two thirds of Iowa.  Surface temperatures in these areas reached the 60s north, with 70s south.  With the atmosphere primed, the dry line began to move into Iowa.  Dew point temperatures behind the dry line were in the 30s with southwest winds of 30 to 50 MPH.  A broken squall line formed on the nose of the dry punch and became severe quickly.  The storm cells themselves were not all that large, but nearly every cell along the line did carry a mesoscale circulation.  There were several tornado touchdowns as the line lifted north as well.  The primary severe weather during this even was the tornadic nature of it.  There were reports of wind and hail, but everything considered these reports were pretty scattered.  There were very few reports of wind and hail with the first supercell as it lifted north out of Missouri.  One inch diameter hail was reported in Ringgold County east of Redding.  Reports of winds and hail were more frequent with the second line of thunderstorms.  There were numerous reports of hail up to marble size with this line, however there were not all that many reports of hail larger than that.  A few reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail were received from Marion and Polk Counties.  The most significant hail occurred in northeast Iowa in Butler County.  Golf ball size hail fell in the town of Parkersburg as the line passed over the city.  There were more reports of wind with the second round.  Nearly all locations reported winds of at least 50 MPH as the line passed overhead.  Scattered reports of winds of 70 to 85 MPH were received.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County as high winds downed power lines and downed outbuildings north of Ogden.  The greatest wind damage occurred over northeast Iowa in Black Hawk and Franklin Counties.  A building was blown off of its foundation and onto an adjacent road southwest of Hampton in Franklin County.  A roof of a barn was damaged and a grain wagon was tipped over northwest of Hampton.  Roof and house damage was reported over parts of Black Hawk County as well.  Five injuries occurred in Warren County at Carlisle when winds of around 65 MPH toppled a school bus.  Twenty one children were on board the bus when it overturned with 5 treated for minor injuries.  Spotty damage was reported around the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.   Several tornadoes occurred with this system.  The most significant tornado entered southern Iowa around mid day.  This  tornado reached minimal F3 intensity just east of Mt. Ayr (Ringgold County).  Property damage is estimated at over $500,000 in Ringgold county alone. Across the Des Moines area of responsibility, at least 15 homes were destroyed, and 60 residences were damaged as around a dozen tornadoes touched down.  A supercell thunderstorm moved north from Missouri into southern Iowa late in the morning of April 11.  The storm produced a tornado in northern Missouri and crossed into Iowa in Ringgold County. The storm, and tornado, moved north through Ringgold County with a continuous damage path half way through the county.   The damage path continued north through northern Ringgold County, southeast Union County and into northwest Clarke County.  In this area, the path was not continuous.  Based on damage reports, the tornado continued to produce occasional damage in Madison County.  Chaser reports indicate the tornado had a multi-vortex structure as it moved through Ringgold and Union Counties.  The last reported sighting was in northern Polk County where a brief touchdown was reported with no damage.  The storm likely produced one tornado from the Missouri border to Madison County with an intermittent damage track.   Damage in Ringgold County was severe with initial estimates around $1 million.  The county was later declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.  A second tornado briefly touched down in northern Polk County.  The touchdown in Polk County was indeed a separate tornado.  Even though the tornado was from the same parent cell, the system had occluded and was in the process of forming a new tornado as it passed over the western part of the Des Moines area.  Reports from this tornado indicate that at least 9 homes were damaged or destroyed, one business destroyed, and a school building damaged.  In addition to losses to homes, one farmstead was hit with considerable damage and some livestock damage.  A series of tornadoes formed on the heels of the supercell tornado as the dry line pushed into the state.  Most of these were brief touchdowns, however the storms were moving around 60 MPH.  Three tornadoes touched down in Boone County.  The most significant tornado touched down north of Ogden.  It produced a 3 mile long track up to 1/8 mile wide.  Farm site hit along highway P70.  Barn and grain bins destroyed, knocking out windows in house. Otherwise only minor damage to house. Debris scattered 1 mile to next farm site where there was minor damage to many buildings. Track continued north-northeast across highway E26 into the campground at Don Williams Lake. A storage building was destroyed, several trees downed, plus outhouses, picnic tables and signs were damaged. The damage track dissipated on the northeast side of the Don Williams Recreation Area.  There were several brief touchdowns with relatively minor damage in Guthrie, Greene, and Hamilton Counties.  A stronger tornado touched down in southeast Black Hawk County, causing significant damage to two homes in the La Porte City area.  The most serious tornado in terms of loss of life occurred in Wapello County.  A tornado developed in rural southern Wapello County, a mile southwest of Agency, Iowa, around 1600 CDT, on Wednesday, April 11.  The tornado path was 50 to 100 yards wide with sporadic touchdowns toward the north-northeast for the next 6 miles.    Survey responses indicated that the duration of impact at any one location was only 15 to 30 seconds as the tornado quickly moved through Agency and over farms at a 60 mph horizontal movement.   The Odd Fellows Lodge in Agency was destroyed, and over 50 residences were damaged.  Two women inside were killed, three people injured and three people had no injuries.  As the storm moved through Agency, a garage was lifted and carried about 100 meters off of its foundation.  The car inside was twisted and covered with debris.  In another incident, one house was hit by the tornado causing damage to the house.  The family dog was in the dog pen at the time.  The tornado lifted the pen and twirled it through the air.  The dog pen was deposited some distance downstream and what was truly amazing was the fact that the dog was uninjured.  Following the tornado, U.S. Highway 34 was closed for 2 hours in order to removed debris from the highway. Governor Tom Vilsack visited the area during a storm survey.  The governor spoke with Brenda Brock of the  National Weather Service, Ellen Gordon, Administrator, Iowa Emergency Management Division, emergency management personnel (fire department, law enforcement, mayor) and the public.

The cold front from the previous storm did not move all that far to the south of Iowa.  As a result, warm and moist air was able to move north into Iowa rapidly.  A warm front lifted into southern Iowa during the late afternoon hours, sending temperatures into the 80s over parts of southern Iowa.  Dew point temperatures jumped into the low to mid 60s.  The atmosphere became very unstable with thunderstorms developing along the front.  Most of the storms were associated with the warm front itself,  though  a mesoscale feature moved along the front setting the stage for an additional like of thunderstorms that developed north to south in south central Iowa.  The main feature with the storms was hail.  There were numerous reports of hail ranging from nickel size up to golf ball size.  Several of the storms had well developed meso circulations associated with them.  A few tornadoes resulted.  Two of the tornadoes were very small and only touched down briefly in Tama and Dallas Counties.  The other tornadoes were stronger.  One tornado touched down in Decatur County near Leon.  Two people were injured, one requiring hospitalization, as a mobile home was overturned by the gust front ahead of the storm itself.  The second of the stronger tornadoes moved through Adams County.  A trailer house was overturned and the roofs were removed from two sheds on a farm northeast of Mt. Etna.  Thunderstorms produced very heavy rainfall of one to two inches per hour over Ringgold County.  Total rainfall approached 4 inches in less than 3 hours as storms repeatedly moved across the same areas.  The rain caused flash flooding in the county.  In one instance, Lotts Creek overtopped a road southeast of Mt. Ayr, causing nearly $50,000 in damage as the road washed out.   As the storms moved through Decatur County, lightning stuck a house in Garde Grove.  The house was set on fire, but it was not detected for several hours after the lightning strike.  The house was destroyed and completely burned to the ground.",Minor damage in rural area with brief touchdown.,PDS

A warm front lifted north across the state during the previous day, allowing a strong surge of moisture to flow north from the Gulf of Mexico.  Temperatures rose into the 70s to low 80s as surface dew point temperatures rose into the upper 50s and 60s across the state.  By the early evening hours, a frontal boundary extended from near Sioux City east-northeast into the northeast corner of the state.  Thunderstorms fired along this front and became severe during the evening.  These storms produced very heavy rain with numerous reports of hail.  For the most part, the hail was around an inch in diameter with the storms.  There were a few reports of hail up to the size of golf balls however.  Reports of golf ball size hail were received from the Ringsted area of Emmet County, and also from the Fraser area of Boone County.   Two things were taking place during the evening.  While the thunderstorms were firing along the warm front over northern Iowa, a strong low pressure system was racing out of Colorado.  CAPE values across northeast Kansas into Iowa were in the 2000 to 3000 J/Kg range as a dry line extending south from the low approached the area.  Strong thunderstorms developed over northeast Colorado and raced east across Nebraska and Kansas.  The thunderstorms took on a bow echo configuration as they headed across the Plains at more than 60 MPH.   High winds raked Nebraska and Kansas before moving into Iowa.  There were numerous reports of winds of 60 to 80 MPH as the line advanced across the west half of Iowa with numerous reports of trees and power lines downed.  As the storms moved through Carroll County, several outbuildings were destroyed in the Templeton area.  Machine sheds were totally destroyed in Adair County by the high winds.  Further northwest, in Greene County, a barn was flattened north of Scranton.  Damage continued as the storms continued east with reports of outbuildings damaged or destroyed toward Hamilton County. One of the most damaging events of the night took place late in the storm cycle.  The storms turned into wind producers.  High winds hit the Lake Mills area in Winnebago County for example.  A barn and several sheds were destroyed by the winds around 80 MPH.   As the storms moved into Hardin County, a microburst occurred west of the Iowa Falls area with winds estimated around 85 MPH.  A tornado touched down briefly in the community of Alden, causing considerable damage in the town.  The tornado touched down in two locations of the town, damaging several buildings four blocks apart.    Concrete blocks were picked up and thrown 50 to 75 yards and roofs of the affected buildings were strewn one quarter to three eighths of a mile downstream.  One business was damages with estimated damage around $180,000.  On a farm at the edge of town damage was estimated at $100,000.  Numerous trees were downed on Highways 491 and D15, blocking travel in the area.  Shortly after this event occurred, the storms weakened and continued moving northeast.",Short touchdown within the town of Alden.,PDS

Intense surface low pressure formed over western Kansas with a central pressure by sunrise on the 11th of 977 Mb.  The weather situation was very dynamic with 500 Mb winds over 100 kts and a very sharp dry punch clearly visible on the satellite pictures.  During the day the warm front that extended east from the low reached into southern Iowa, then extended eastward.  There were two things that occurred during the day.  The first was a very strong supercell that formed over northern Missouri during the morning.  This storm lifted north-northeast at about 50 kts into Iowa, producing a long track tornado with a path extending nearly all the way to Des Moines.  During the afternoon the warm front surged north with the northeast progression of the surface dry line.  Dew points rose into the mid 60s to the south of the warm front across much of the southeast half to two thirds of Iowa.  Surface temperatures in these areas reached the 60s north, with 70s south.  With the atmosphere primed, the dry line began to move into Iowa.  Dew point temperatures behind the dry line were in the 30s with southwest winds of 30 to 50 MPH.  A broken squall line formed on the nose of the dry punch and became severe quickly.  The storm cells themselves were not all that large, but nearly every cell along the line did carry a mesoscale circulation.  There were several tornado touchdowns as the line lifted north as well.  The primary severe weather during this even was the tornadic nature of it.  There were reports of wind and hail, but everything considered these reports were pretty scattered.  There were very few reports of wind and hail with the first supercell as it lifted north out of Missouri.  One inch diameter hail was reported in Ringgold County east of Redding.  Reports of winds and hail were more frequent with the second line of thunderstorms.  There were numerous reports of hail up to marble size with this line, however there were not all that many reports of hail larger than that.  A few reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail were received from Marion and Polk Counties.  The most significant hail occurred in northeast Iowa in Butler County.  Golf ball size hail fell in the town of Parkersburg as the line passed over the city.  There were more reports of wind with the second round.  Nearly all locations reported winds of at least 50 MPH as the line passed overhead.  Scattered reports of winds of 70 to 85 MPH were received.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County as high winds downed power lines and downed outbuildings north of Ogden.  The greatest wind damage occurred over northeast Iowa in Black Hawk and Franklin Counties.  A building was blown off of its foundation and onto an adjacent road southwest of Hampton in Franklin County.  A roof of a barn was damaged and a grain wagon was tipped over northwest of Hampton.  Roof and house damage was reported over parts of Black Hawk County as well.  Five injuries occurred in Warren County at Carlisle when winds of around 65 MPH toppled a school bus.  Twenty one children were on board the bus when it overturned with 5 treated for minor injuries.  Spotty damage was reported around the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.   Several tornadoes occurred with this system.  The most significant tornado entered southern Iowa around mid day.  This  tornado reached minimal F3 intensity just east of Mt. Ayr (Ringgold County).  Property damage is estimated at over $500,000 in Ringgold county alone. Across the Des Moines area of responsibility, at least 15 homes were destroyed, and 60 residences were damaged as around a dozen tornadoes touched down.  A supercell thunderstorm moved north from Missouri into southern Iowa late in the morning of April 11.  The storm produced a tornado in northern Missouri and crossed into Iowa in Ringgold County. The storm, and tornado, moved north through Ringgold County with a continuous damage path half way through the county.   The damage path continued north through northern Ringgold County, southeast Union County and into northwest Clarke County.  In this area, the path was not continuous.  Based on damage reports, the tornado continued to produce occasional damage in Madison County.  Chaser reports indicate the tornado had a multi-vortex structure as it moved through Ringgold and Union Counties.  The last reported sighting was in northern Polk County where a brief touchdown was reported with no damage.  The storm likely produced one tornado from the Missouri border to Madison County with an intermittent damage track.   Damage in Ringgold County was severe with initial estimates around $1 million.  The county was later declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.  A second tornado briefly touched down in northern Polk County.  The touchdown in Polk County was indeed a separate tornado.  Even though the tornado was from the same parent cell, the system had occluded and was in the process of forming a new tornado as it passed over the western part of the Des Moines area.  Reports from this tornado indicate that at least 9 homes were damaged or destroyed, one business destroyed, and a school building damaged.  In addition to losses to homes, one farmstead was hit with considerable damage and some livestock damage.  A series of tornadoes formed on the heels of the supercell tornado as the dry line pushed into the state.  Most of these were brief touchdowns, however the storms were moving around 60 MPH.  Three tornadoes touched down in Boone County.  The most significant tornado touched down north of Ogden.  It produced a 3 mile long track up to 1/8 mile wide.  Farm site hit along highway P70.  Barn and grain bins destroyed, knocking out windows in house. Otherwise only minor damage to house. Debris scattered 1 mile to next farm site where there was minor damage to many buildings. Track continued north-northeast across highway E26 into the campground at Don Williams Lake. A storage building was destroyed, several trees downed, plus outhouses, picnic tables and signs were damaged. The damage track dissipated on the northeast side of the Don Williams Recreation Area.  There were several brief touchdowns with relatively minor damage in Guthrie, Greene, and Hamilton Counties.  A stronger tornado touched down in southeast Black Hawk County, causing significant damage to two homes in the La Porte City area.  The most serious tornado in terms of loss of life occurred in Wapello County.  A tornado developed in rural southern Wapello County, a mile southwest of Agency, Iowa, around 1600 CDT, on Wednesday, April 11.  The tornado path was 50 to 100 yards wide with sporadic touchdowns toward the north-northeast for the next 6 miles.    Survey responses indicated that the duration of impact at any one location was only 15 to 30 seconds as the tornado quickly moved through Agency and over farms at a 60 mph horizontal movement.   The Odd Fellows Lodge in Agency was destroyed, and over 50 residences were damaged.  Two women inside were killed, three people injured and three people had no injuries.

Intense surface low pressure formed over western Kansas with a central pressure by sunrise on the 11th of 977 Mb.  The weather situation was very dynamic with 500 Mb winds over 100 kts and a very sharp dry punch clearly visible on the satellite pictures.  During the day the warm front that extended east from the low reached into southern Iowa, then extended eastward.  There were two things that occurred during the day.  The first was a very strong supercell that formed over northern Missouri during the morning.  This storm lifted north-northeast at about 50 kts into Iowa, producing a long track tornado with a path extending nearly all the way to Des Moines.  During the afternoon the warm front surged north with the northeast progression of the surface dry line.  Dew points rose into the mid 60s to the south of the warm front across much of the southeast half to two thirds of Iowa.  Surface temperatures in these areas reached the 60s north, with 70s south.  With the atmosphere primed, the dry line began to move into Iowa.  Dew point temperatures behind the dry line were in the 30s with southwest winds of 30 to 50 MPH.  A broken squall line formed on the nose of the dry punch and became severe quickly.  The storm cells themselves were not all that large, but nearly every cell along the line did carry a mesoscale circulation.  There were several tornado touchdowns as the line lifted north as well.  The primary severe weather during this even was the tornadic nature of it.  There were reports of wind and hail, but everything considered these reports were pretty scattered.  There were very few reports of wind and hail with the first supercell as it lifted north out of Missouri.  One inch diameter hail was reported in Ringgold County east of Redding.  Reports of winds and hail were more frequent with the second line of thunderstorms.  There were numerous reports of hail up to marble size with this line, however there were not all that many reports of hail larger than that.  A few reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail were received from Marion and Polk Counties.  The most significant hail occurred in northeast Iowa in Butler County.  Golf ball size hail fell in the town of Parkersburg as the line passed over the city.  There were more reports of wind with the second round.  Nearly all locations reported winds of at least 50 MPH as the line passed overhead.  Scattered reports of winds of 70 to 85 MPH were received.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County as high winds downed power lines and downed outbuildings north of Ogden.  The greatest wind damage occurred over northeast Iowa in Black Hawk and Franklin Counties.  A building was blown off of its foundation and onto an adjacent road southwest of Hampton in Franklin County.  A roof of a barn was damaged and a grain wagon was tipped over northwest of Hampton.  Roof and house damage was reported over parts of Black Hawk County as well.  Five injuries occurred in Warren County at Carlisle when winds of around 65 MPH toppled a school bus.  Twenty one children were on board the bus when it overturned with 5 treated for minor injuries.  Spotty damage was reported around the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.   Several tornadoes occurred with this system.  The most significant tornado entered southern Iowa around mid day.  This  tornado reached minimal F3 intensity just east of Mt. Ayr (Ringgold County).  Property damage is estimated at over $500,000 in Ringgold county alone. Across the Des Moines area of responsibility, at least 15 homes were destroyed, and 60 residences were damaged as around a dozen tornadoes touched down.  A supercell thunderstorm moved north from Missouri into southern Iowa late in the morning of April 11.  The storm produced a tornado in northern Missouri and crossed into Iowa in Ringgold County. The storm, and tornado, moved north through Ringgold County with a continuous damage path half way through the county.   The damage path continued north through northern Ringgold County, southeast Union County and into northwest Clarke County.  In this area, the path was not continuous.  Based on damage reports, the tornado continued to produce occasional damage in Madison County.  Chaser reports indicate the tornado had a multi-vortex structure as it moved through Ringgold and Union Counties.  The last reported sighting was in northern Polk County where a brief touchdown was reported with no damage.  The storm likely produced one tornado from the Missouri border to Madison County with an intermittent damage track.   Damage in Ringgold County was severe with initial estimates around $1 million.  The county was later declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.  A second tornado briefly touched down in northern Polk County.  The touchdown in Polk County was indeed a separate tornado.  Even though the tornado was from the same parent cell, the system had occluded and was in the process of forming a new tornado as it passed over the western part of the Des Moines area.  Reports from this tornado indicate that at least 9 homes were damaged or destroyed, one business destroyed, and a school building damaged.  In addition to losses to homes, one farmstead was hit with considerable damage and some livestock damage.  A series of tornadoes formed on the heels of the supercell tornado as the dry line pushed into the state.  Most of these were brief touchdowns, however the storms were moving around 60 MPH.  Three tornadoes touched down in Boone County.  The most significant tornado touched down north of Ogden.  It produced a 3 mile long track up to 1/8 mile wide.  Farm site hit along highway P70.  Barn and grain bins destroyed, knocking out windows in house. Otherwise only minor damage to house. Debris scattered 1 mile to next farm site where there was minor damage to many buildings. Track continued north-northeast across highway E26 into the campground at Don Williams Lake. A storage building was destroyed, several trees downed, plus outhouses, picnic tables and signs were damaged. The damage track dissipated on the northeast side of the Don Williams Recreation Area.  There were several brief touchdowns with relatively minor damage in Guthrie, Greene, and Hamilton Counties.  A stronger tornado touched down in southeast Black Hawk County, causing significant damage to two homes in the La Porte City area.  The most serious tornado in terms of loss of life occurred in Wapello County.  A tornado developed in rural southern Wapello County, a mile southwest of Agency, Iowa, around 1600 CDT, on Wednesday, April 11.  The tornado path was 50 to 100 yards wide with sporadic touchdowns toward the north-northeast for the next 6 miles.

Intense surface low pressure formed over western Kansas with a central pressure by sunrise on the 11th of 977 Mb.  The weather situation was very dynamic with 500 Mb winds over 100 kts and a very sharp dry punch clearly visible on the satellite pictures.  During the day the warm front that extended east from the low reached into southern Iowa, then extended eastward.  There were two things that occurred during the day.  The first was a very strong supercell that formed over northern Missouri during the morning.  This storm lifted north-northeast at about 50 kts into Iowa, producing a long track tornado with a path extending nearly all the way to Des Moines.  During the afternoon the warm front surged north with the northeast progression of the surface dry line.  Dew points rose into the mid 60s to the south of the warm front across much of the southeast half to two thirds of Iowa.  Surface temperatures in these areas reached the 60s north, with 70s south.  With the atmosphere primed, the dry line began to move into Iowa.  Dew point temperatures behind the dry line were in the 30s with southwest winds of 30 to 50 MPH.  A broken squall line formed on the nose of the dry punch and became severe quickly.  The storm cells themselves were not all that large, but nearly every cell along the line did carry a mesoscale circulation.  There were several tornado touchdowns as the line lifted north as well.  The primary severe weather during this even was the tornadic nature of it.  There were reports of wind and hail, but everything considered these reports were pretty scattered.  There were very few reports of wind and hail with the first supercell as it lifted north out of Missouri.  One inch diameter hail was reported in Ringgold County east of Redding.  Reports of winds and hail were more frequent with the second line of thunderstorms.  There were numerous reports of hail up to marble size with this line, however there were not all that many reports of hail larger than that.  A few reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail were received from Marion and Polk Counties.  The most significant hail occurred in northeast Iowa in Butler County.  Golf ball size hail fell in the town of Parkersburg as the line passed over the city.  There were more reports of wind with the second round.  Nearly all locations reported winds of at least 50 MPH as the line passed overhead.  Scattered reports of winds of 70 to 85 MPH were received.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County as high winds downed power lines and downed outbuildings north of Ogden.  The greatest wind damage occurred over northeast Iowa in Black Hawk and Franklin Counties.  A building was blown off of its foundation and onto an adjacent road southwest of Hampton in Franklin County.  A roof of a barn was damaged and a grain wagon was tipped over northwest of Hampton.  Roof and house damage was reported over parts of Black Hawk County as well.  Five injuries occurred in Warren County at Carlisle when winds of around 65 MPH toppled a school bus.  Twenty one children were on board the bus when it overturned with 5 treated for minor injuries.  Spotty damage was reported around the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.   Several tornadoes occurred with this system.  The most significant tornado entered southern Iowa around mid day.  This  tornado reached minimal F3 intensity just east of Mt. Ayr (Ringgold County).  Property damage is estimated at over $500,000 in Ringgold county alone. Across the Des Moines area of responsibility, at least 15 homes were destroyed, and 60 residences were damaged as around a dozen tornadoes touched down.  A supercell thunderstorm moved north from Missouri into southern Iowa late in the morning of April 11.  The storm produced a tornado in northern Missouri and crossed into Iowa in Ringgold County. The storm, and tornado, moved north through Ringgold County with a continuous damage path half way through the county.   The damage path continued north through northern Ringgold County, southeast Union County and into northwest Clarke County.  In this area, the path was not continuous.  Based on damage reports, the tornado continued to produce occasional damage in Madison County.  Chaser reports indicate the tornado had a multi-vortex structure as it moved through Ringgold and Union Counties.  The last reported sighting was in northern Polk County where a brief touchdown was reported with no damage.  The storm likely produced one tornado from the Missouri border to Madison County with an intermittent damage track.   Damage in Ringgold County was severe with initial estimates around $1 million.  The county was later declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.  A second tornado briefly touched down in northern Polk County.  The touchdown in Polk County was indeed a separate tornado.  Even though the tornado was from the same parent cell, the system had occluded and was in the process of forming a new tornado as it passed over the western part of the Des Moines area.  Reports from this tornado indicate that at least 9 homes were damaged or destroyed, one business destroyed, and a school building damaged.  In addition to losses to homes, one farmstead was hit with considerable damage and some livestock damage.  A series of tornadoes formed on the heels of the supercell tornado as the dry line pushed into the state.  Most of these were brief touchdowns, however the storms were moving around 60 MPH.  Three tornadoes touched down in Boone County.  The most significant tornado touched down north of Ogden.  It produced a 3 mile long track up to 1/8 mile wide.  Farm site hit along highway P70.  Barn and grain bins destroyed, knocking out windows in house. Otherwise only minor damage to house. Debris scattered 1 mile to next farm site where there was minor damage to many buildings. Track continued north-northeast across highway E26 into the campground at Don Williams Lake. A storage building was destroyed, several trees downed, plus outhouses, picnic tables and signs were damaged. The damage track dissipated on the northeast side of the Don Williams Recreation Area.  There were several brief touchdowns with relatively minor damage in Guthrie, Greene, and Hamilton Counties.  A stronger tornado touched down in southeast Black Hawk County, causing significant damage to two homes in the La Porte City area.  The most serious tornado in terms of loss of life occurred in Wapello County.  A tornado developed in rural southern Wapello County, a mile southwest of Agency, Iowa, around 1600 CDT, on Wednesday, April 11.  The tornado path was 50 to 100 yards wide with sporadic touchdowns toward the north-northeast for the next 6 miles.    Survey responses indicated that the duration of impact at any one location was only 15 to 30 seconds as the tornado quickly moved through Agency and over farms at a 60 mph horizontal movement.   The Odd Fellows Lodge in Agency was destroyed, and over 50 residences were damaged.  Two women inside were killed, three people injured and three people had no injuries.

This helped to destabilize the atmosphere as freezing levels fell to the 8000 to 10,000 foot range by evening.  A small area of thunderstorms developed by mid day over north central Iowa.  The storms intensified rapidly during the maximum heating of the day.  Thunderstorms fired southwest of the original area and became severe quickly.  For the most part the storms produced hail and small tornadoes.  The first tornado touched in Crawford County.  The county Emergency Manager reported seeing 7 funnel clouds and two brief touchdowns with the initial cell.  The tornadoes were all small and were only on the ground briefly.  Several other brief touchdowns occurred in the County before the storm moved east.  The strongest tornado touched down on the edge of the town of Denison.  A 14 x 50 metal building was destroyed.  A fire hydrant was damaged in the vicinity by flying debris.  It was reported that water could be seen being sucked out of the hydrant by the tornado.  The tornado threat shifted into northeast Iowa for the rest of the afternoon.  Several tornadoes touched down in Bremer, Butler, and Black Hawk Counties.  Most of these were quite small and did little damage however.  The longest track tornado touched down in the Janesville area of Bremer County and tracked over 8 miles to the east, lifting just east of the town of Denver.  The countryside is quite open between these two locations.  For this reason, damage was minimal as the tornado actually missed both of the towns.  With the cold air aloft, hail was a significant factor.  There were reports of at least half inch diameter hail with nearly all of the storms.  Numerous reports of hail of an inch up to golf ball size were received.  The storms produced three inch diameter hail on the north side of Belmond, causing significant damage to the area and reportedly covering the ground.  One of the storms became very intense over Butler County during the early afternoon.  Softball size hail was reported with this cell, causing significant damage south of the town of Allison.  The storms over southwest Iowa underwent a transition into more of a wind event.  High winds were reported in Cass County as the storms moved through the Griswold area.  By mid afternoon, the storms in southern Iowa had taken on a bow configuration.  As the storms moved through Adair County, very strong winds swept through the northeast part of the county.

The dynamics were sufficient to overcome the shortcomings in moisture available for the system.  A cold front dropped southeast out of the Dakotas into Iowa during the afternoon.  Surface dew points were generally in the mid 50s ahead of the front, though a narrow ribbon of upper 50s to lower 60s was found just ahead of the front.  As the cold front dropped southeast, a very strong closed low at 500 mb was also dropping into the area.  This helped to destabilize the atmosphere as freezing levels fell to the 8000 to 10,000 foot range by evening.  A small area of thunderstorms developed by mid day over north central Iowa.  The storms intensified rapidly during the maximum heating of the day.  Thunderstorms fired southwest of the original area and became severe quickly.  For the most part the storms produced hail and small tornadoes.  The first tornado touched in Crawford County.  The county Emergency Manager reported seeing 7 funnel clouds and two brief touchdowns with the initial cell.  The tornadoes were all small and were only on the ground briefly.  Several other brief touchdowns occurred in the County before the storm moved east.  The strongest tornado touched down on the edge of the town of Denison.  A 14 x 50 metal building was destroyed.  A fire hydrant was damaged in the vicinity by flying debris.  It was reported that water could be seen being sucked out of the hydrant by the tornado.  The tornado threat shifted into northeast Iowa for the rest of the afternoon.  Several tornadoes touched down in Bremer, Butler, and Black Hawk Counties.  Most of these were quite small and did little damage however.  The longest track tornado touched down in the Janesville area of Bremer County and tracked over 8 miles to the east, lifting just east of the town of Denver.  The countryside is quite open between these two locations.  For this reason, damage was minimal as the tornado actually missed both of the towns.  With the cold air aloft, hail was a significant factor.  There were reports of at least half inch diameter hail with nearly all of the storms.  Numerous reports of hail of an inch up to golf ball size were received.  The storms produced three inch diameter hail on the north side of Belmond, causing significant damage to the area and reportedly covering the ground.

Four houses had severe roof damage and about a dozen others suffered minor damage. A construction trailer was tossed and two vehicles were overturned. Between 150 and 200 trees were either uprooted or damaged. Tree damage was so extensive that Hawkins Road Park was closed. The area was littered with broken pieces of wood, shingles, gutters and parts of roofs. The tornado's path length was about 1.5 miles and its path width was around 200 feet. No injuries were reported. This was the first strong tornado in New Jersey since August 20, 1999 and the first strong tornado in Monmouth County since October 16, 1955.The tornado first touched down near Arbach Lane in Manalapan Township. It initially was relatively weak (F0) on the Fujita Scale, but intensified into an F1 tornado before it reached Kentucky Court. One property on Kentucky Court lost dozens of trees. The tornado also downed trees on Ivanhoe and Rowena Roads. The tornado reached its maximum strength (F2) as it passed through Debracy Court where the worst damage occurred. Four homes suffered severe roof damage. The roof and second floor of one home had to be completely repaired. The windows of another house all burst. A restored Thunderbird was damaged by flying debris that penetrated the garage door. The house apparently shifted as doors no longer closed. A third home on the block had a picnic table blown into its sunroom along with a piece of the neighbor's fence. Patio furniture was splintered throughout the block. A minivan parked in one driveway, was rolled about 40 feet. The tornado weakened to an F1 after it left Debracy Court. Nevertheless, it tore shingles from a home on Eastwood Boulevard and downed a tree onto a car. A construction trailer on Hawkins Corner Road was blown 50 feet across the street and crushed like an aluminum can.  As the tornado crossed into Marlboro Township, it knocked down dozens of trees in Hawkins Road Park. The part was closed because of the uprooted trees. As the tornado exited the park, it weakened to an F0. It still knocked a tree onto a house on MacLeisch Drive and ripped shingles and gutters from homes on Guest and MacLeisch Drives.

Thankfully, the golf carts were equipped with G.P.S. units, and the course sent a message out on those units that a tornado was approaching.  Only one person on the course suffered a minor injury (exact injury undisclosed).  Three homes were destroyed near Clyde Road and US-23, as were a party store and a towing company that shared a building.  A man at the party store suffered a minor hand injury, and two vehicles at the towing company were totaled.  Several hundred trees were downed in this general area.Further north, several cars and semis were flipped when the tornado crossed US-23.

This thunderstorm produced a tornado over the Potomac River just before coming ashore near Clifton on the Potomac just north of the Route 301 bridge.  An employee at the Route 301 bridge toll booth just east of the shoreline reported seeing a waterspout form just offshore and north of the Governor Harry W. Nice Bridge.  The waterspout came ashore at the Aqua-Land Marina less than one quarter mile north of the bridge.  A boathouse at the marina was hit by the twister and lost nearly half of its exposed 150 foot roof.  Six boats beneath the roof were damaged by fallen debris.  In addition, trees were downed in and along the access road to the Aqua-Land campground.  Next, the tornado moved east-northeast across the southern portion of the Clifton on the Potomac subdivision where it downed or snapped several trees.  Very little damage was reported to homes.  A survey team found a path of downed trees that continued east-northeast across Route 301 near the Crain Memorial Travel and Visitors Center to just south of the intersection of Route 257 and Mount Victoria Road in Newburg.  The tornado apparently dissipated near Mount Victoria Road.  The F1 tornado was on the ground for 1.2 miles and was estimated to be 40 yards wide.  Strong winds also accompanied the storm and trees were downed at the intersection of Route 301 and 234 about 4 miles north of Newburg.  The thunderstorm weakened after it exited the Newburg area, but was of sufficient strength as it moved over La Plata to produce pea sized hail around 3:40 AM EDT.  When the storm moved over Waldorf, marble to nickel sized hail fell.",A waterspout came ashore at Clifton on the Potomac and reached Newburg before dissipating.,PDS

The dynamics were sufficient to overcome the shortcomings in moisture available for the system.  A cold front dropped southeast out of the Dakotas into Iowa during the afternoon.  Surface dew points were generally in the mid 50s ahead of the front, though a narrow ribbon of upper 50s to lower 60s was found just ahead of the front.  As the cold front dropped southeast, a very strong closed low at 500 mb was also dropping into the area.  This helped to destabilize the atmosphere as freezing levels fell to the 8000 to 10,000 foot range by evening.  A small area of thunderstorms developed by mid day over north central Iowa.  The storms intensified rapidly during the maximum heating of the day.  Thunderstorms fired southwest of the original area and became severe quickly.  For the most part the storms produced hail and small tornadoes.  The first tornado touched in Crawford County.  The county Emergency Manager reported seeing 7 funnel clouds and two brief touchdowns with the initial cell.  The tornadoes were all small and were only on the ground briefly.  Several other brief touchdowns occurred in the County before the storm moved east.  The strongest tornado touched down on the edge of the town of Denison.  A 14 x 50 metal building was destroyed.  A fire hydrant was damaged in the vicinity by flying debris.  It was reported that water could be seen being sucked out of the hydrant by the tornado.  The tornado threat shifted into northeast Iowa for the rest of the afternoon.  Several tornadoes touched down in Bremer, Butler, and Black Hawk Counties.  Most of these were quite small and did little damage however.  The longest track tornado touched down in the Janesville area of Bremer County and tracked over 8 miles to the east, lifting just east of the town of Denver.  The countryside is quite open between these two locations.  For this reason, damage was minimal as the tornado actually missed both of the towns.  With the cold air aloft, hail was a significant factor.  There were reports of at least half inch diameter hail with nearly all of the storms.  Numerous reports of hail of an inch up to golf ball size were received.  The storms produced three inch diameter hail on the north side of Belmond, causing significant damage to the area and reportedly covering the ground.  One of the storms became very intense over Butler County during the early afternoon.  Softball size hail was reported with this cell, causing significant damage south of the town of Allison.  The storms over southwest Iowa underwent a transition into more of a wind event.  High winds were reported in Cass County as the storms moved through the Griswold area.  By mid afternoon, the storms in southern Iowa had taken on a bow configuration.  As the storms moved through Adair County, very strong winds swept through the northeast part of the county.   The winds toppled power lines northeast of Greenfield.  As the storms continued east, the intensity decreased.  The storms still produced gusty winds, but speeds were generally in the 45 to 55 MPH range.",Emergency manager reported spotting 7 funnel clouds from the parent cell with two brief touchdowns in open country.,PDS

In Shenandoah County, a home in Strasburg was struck by lightning.  Marble sized hail was reported in Tom's Brook.  Trees and power lines were downed by high wind in Orkney Springs.  In Warren County, an F1 tornado touched down around 1 mile southwest of Ashby, just south of Route 639.  The tornado moved east-northeast and crossed Route 639 just east of Ashby.  Shortly after, it crossed Route 658 just south of White Oak Level and moved into Clarke County at Milldale Road (Route 624).  Before exiting the county, the tornado struck three farms just east of Ashby.  It tore the tin roof off a barn and threw it 100 yards.  A farmhouse suffered a projectile hole and minor damage to trim and a window.  The tornado also damaged a silo, several sheds, and small outbuildings.  In addition, numerous trees were uprooted and snapped along the tornado's 4 mile long and 100 yard wide path.  The tornado remained on the ground for another mile after it crossed into Clarke County at Milldale Road (Route 624), about 3 miles southeast of Stone Bridge.  Several trees were downed on the roadway at this location.  The tornado traveled to the northeast through woodlands, then dissipated about 5 miles east of Stone Bridge.  In addition, a funnel cloud was spotted by a police officer over White Post, north of the tornadic storm.  The officer followed the storm that produced the funnel cloud from White Post to Berryville and saw the funnel drop down several times, but never touch the ground.  The only damage reported from this storm was from large amounts of golfball sized hail that accumulated up to 6 inches in depth between Double Tollgate and White Post.  The large hail damaged an asphalt roof, a flat membrane roof, and light fixtures.  It was also responsible for chipping paint off a home and stripping leaves off vegetation. In Loudoun County, a storm downed several large trees near the intersection of Algonkian Parkway and Countryside Boulevard west of Sterling in the Cascades subdivision.The second round of storms moved through the western suburbs of Washington D.C. between 6 and 7 PM EDT and produced winds as high as 80 MPH, large hail, and heavy downpours.  In Loudoun County, a strong downburst of wind estimated between 60 and 80 MPH crashed down onto the Countryside subdivision west of Sterling.  The strongest winds hit the Foxfield section near where it backs up to the Broad Run Farms subdivision.  Several townhouses had shingles peeled off their roofs and roof vents were bent upward or torn off.  About a dozen trees were uprooted and others were snapped.  Just north of this area on McPhereson Circle, several other homes had damage to siding and gutters.  Another area of damage was near the intersection of Algonkian Parkway and Countryside Boulevard.  This same area was hit by damaging wind during the first round of storms.  Several more large trees were snapped and a significant carpet of leaf debris was left on the ground and blown into fencing and against housing.  Another small area of wind damage was reported in Ashburn Farm where a tree was downed, a tent was damaged, and a window was blown in.  In addition to high winds, the eastern portion of Loudoun County was pelted by large quantities of hail.  In Countryside, hail as large as golfballs punctures the rear window of a soft topped vehicle and shredded leaves off vegetation.  The hail covered the ground up to 1 inch deep and nickel sized hail could still be found on the ground a day and a half after the storm.

The first sign of damage from the tornado was downed trees at the intersection of Muncaster Mill Road and Bowie Mill Road southwest of Olney.  The tornado tracked east-northeast, passing just north of Magruder High School through North Branch Stream Valley Park.  The damage path reappeared over Norbeck Country Club.  Numerous trees were downed in a narrow area on the north end of the property and an employee saw the funnel cloud touch down.  The damage to trees continued just east of the country club into the Cahsel Manor and Williamsburg Village neighborhoods on the southwest side of Olney.  Over 40 trees were downed across the neighborhood.  A car, shed, power line, and a large fence were significantly damaged by downed trees.  One home sustained damage to a gutter and three other homes had small portions of siding pushed up or removed.  Next, the tornado moved into the center of town and crossed just east of the intersection of Route 97 and 108.  A restaurant just east of the intersection had pieces of roofing and insulation ripped off and carried blocks away.  A few trees in the parking lot were also downed.  Nearby, a strip mall which contained a multi-screen cinema and six shops sustained significant roof damage.  Pieces of roofing material were found over a mile away from the site.  Theater patrons saw ceiling tiles crashing down in the lobby.  Fifty cars in the parking lot had damage to windows and a few storefront windows were also broken.

Very warm and fairly moist air was drawn north into Iowa as the warm front that had been to the south of the state the previous two days lifted north of Iowa during the day on the 18th.  Dew point temperatures were in the low to mid 60s over much of Iowa.  In spite of the relatively low dew points, the airmass became quite unstable.  CAPE values were in the 3000 to 4500 J/kg range by the early evening.  A cold front entered the state during the late afternoon hours.  Thunderstorms developed explosively along the cold frontal boundary by early evening.  A nearly solid like of thunderstorms began to move east across the state.  One tornado was reported in Carroll County south of the Glidden area.  The touchdown was brief and occurred in open country.  Much of the severe weather with this event was in the form of hail.  Numerous locations reported hail anywhere from three quarter inch in diameter up to golf ball size.  The largest hail report was received from Emmet County.  Baseball size hail fell south of the Armstrong area, causing considerable damage to roofs and crops in the area.  As the evening progressed, the storms produced more winds, in part due to the collapse of the line.  high winds caused scattered power outages around the state.  A wind gust in Worth County moved a livestock trailer, pushing the trailer sideways.  The line of thunderstorms weakened rapidly as the midnight hour approached.",Brief touchdown in open area south of town.,PDS

This outflow boundary became established east to west across central Iowa.  At the same time a complex of thunderstorms that was generated by a short wave moving across Nebraska advanced toward western Iowa just before sunrise.  Though upper level jet divergence was in place, a strong mid level cap was in place through most of the night and the outflow boundary never produced any thunderstorm activity.  Temperatures in the mid levels fall significantly around sunrise.  The outflow boundary ""lit up like a Christmas tree"" around sunrise.  The thunderstorms became severe quickly and were large hail producers.  The storms moved east along the east to west line and also produced copious amounts of rainfall.  Initially the threat was the large hail.  Numerous reports of one to two inch diameter hail were received through central Iowa.  Some of the greatest damage occurred in the Des Moines metropolitan area as golf ball size hail pelted the city.  Damage was significant to both roofs as well as cars.  Several large car dealerships were hit on the west side of town with significant damage reported.  Estimates of damage were in the area of $250,000 to $500,000 each.  One off duty NWS employee on the west side has his back window broken out by hail with numerous hail pocks in the car. Initial estimates of damage on the west side of town indicate about 5000 insurance claims for cars at $900 to $1500 each, plus 3000 insurance claims for damages house roofs.  Golf ball size hail and 4 inches of rain fell near Grinnell in Poweshiek County.  Hail drifted to a depth of 2 to 3 feet deep in places.  Crops were totally destroyed as the hail fell for 25 minutes.  One farmer in the area reported 1000 acres of crops destroyed.  Wind was not a major factor with most of these storms.  One high wind report was received in Jasper County south of Prairie City.  Several trees were blown down there.  In addition, one tornado touched down briefly in the county.  The touchdown was in open country west of the town of Montezuma.  The tornado did little damage and lifted in a very short time.  Focus then shifted to the heavy rainfall.  The storms trained along the east west line for several hours.  A band of very heavy rain was reported from Greene County, east into Boone, Story, Dallas, and Polk Counties.  Rainfall of three to four inches was common in these areas.  Numerous roads were closed due to the high water. Water was standing in fields everywhere.  Some of the worst damage occurred in Story County as the densely populated area of Ames and Iowa State University was affected.  By the mid afternoon hours, the thunderstorms weakened and began to lift north slowly.  During the early afternoon hours as the thunderstorms moved through Sac County, lightning struck a tree in the town of Schaller.

In Charles County, a tornado touched down on Panda Court in the Hampshire Lake subdivision about 2.5 miles west of downtown Waldorf.  The tornado tracked northeast across the subdivisions of McDaniel Country Estates, Ashford Oaks, Streamview, and across Route 228 (Berry Road) before crossing into Prince George's County near Acton Lane.  The tornado was 100 yards wide and was ranked an F1.  Over 100 homes received minor damage to siding and roofs, with the most concentrated area of damage in the Streamview neighborhood.  The worst damage included trees putting significant holes into homes, damaged cars, broken windows, a damaged deck, and a downed chimney.  In addition, a shed, tractor, and air conditioning unit were blown over.  The survey team estimated over 100 trees and several power lines were downed in the path of the storm.  As the tornado crossed Route 228 it picked up a truck, spun it around and flipped it over onto the side of the road.  Just north of Route 228, the tornado destroyed three barns at a sod farm.  When the twister reached Acton Lane, it downed several trees and power lines.  About an hour before the tornado touched down near Waldorf, another thunderstorm produced a funnel cloud that apparently never reached the ground just northeast of Indian Head.  Pea sized hail was reported in Bryans Road.  In Prince George's County, the Green Acre Farms area about 4 miles southwest of Brandywine was hit by  the same tornado that damaged several homes just west of Waldorf.  The tornado crossed Mattawoman Creek at the county line near Acton Lane, then pushed northeast across the Green Acre Farms subdivision and Gardner Road.  Several trees were downed in the path of the twister.  Two homes in Green Acre Farms were damaged.  One of the homes on Gardner Road suffered water damage after a tree pushed in a basement door which allowed water runoff to flood the basement.  Another homeowner on Mattawoman Lane had a vehicle significantly damaged by a downed tree.  A nearby shed was picked up off its foundation and thrown 40 feet.  The path of the tornado was clearly visible as a tree top ""V"" pattern in the woodlands behind the home.  A nearby barn was also damaged.  Six occupants in 5 cars on nearby roadways had to be rescued after downed trees and power lines made the roads impassable.  The tornado dissipated in the woods just northeast of Gardner Road before reaching Robin Dale Country Club.  The storm that produced the tornado continued to move northeast across the county.  A funnel cloud was spotted in Brandywine, Camp Springs, and Bowie as the storm passed through.  A wind gust of 63 MPH was recorded at Andrews Air Force Base.  Heavy rain flooded the intersection of Branch Avenue and Brinkley Avenue and roads in Bladensburg.  In Anne Arundel County, a total of 2.04 inches of rain fell in Annapolis.  In St. Mary's County, 1.92 inches of rain was reported in Oraville.",A tornado formed just west of Waldorf and moved northeast into Prince George's County.,PDS

The dynamics were sufficient to overcome the shortcomings in moisture available for the system.  A cold front dropped southeast out of the Dakotas into Iowa during the afternoon.  Surface dew points were generally in the mid 50s ahead of the front, though a narrow ribbon of upper 50s to lower 60s was found just ahead of the front.  As the cold front dropped southeast, a very strong closed low at 500 mb was also dropping into the area.  This helped to destabilize the atmosphere as freezing levels fell to the 8000 to 10,000 foot range by evening.  A small area of thunderstorms developed by mid day over north central Iowa.  The storms intensified rapidly during the maximum heating of the day.  Thunderstorms fired southwest of the original area and became severe quickly.  For the most part the storms produced hail and small tornadoes.  The first tornado touched in Crawford County.  The county Emergency Manager reported seeing 7 funnel clouds and two brief touchdowns with the initial cell.  The tornadoes were all small and were only on the ground briefly.  Several other brief touchdowns occurred in the County before the storm moved east.  The strongest tornado touched down on the edge of the town of Denison.  A 14 x 50 metal building was destroyed.  A fire hydrant was damaged in the vicinity by flying debris.  It was reported that water could be seen being sucked out of the hydrant by the tornado.  The tornado threat shifted into northeast Iowa for the rest of the afternoon.  Several tornadoes touched down in Bremer, Butler, and Black Hawk Counties.  Most of these were quite small and did little damage however.  The longest track tornado touched down in the Janesville area of Bremer County and tracked over 8 miles to the east, lifting just east of the town of Denver.  The countryside is quite open between these two locations.  For this reason, damage was minimal as the tornado actually missed both of the towns.  With the cold air aloft, hail was a significant factor.  There were reports of at least half inch diameter hail with nearly all of the storms.  Numerous reports of hail of an inch up to golf ball size were received.  The storms produced three inch diameter hail on the north side of Belmond, causing significant damage to the area and reportedly covering the ground.  One of the storms became very intense over Butler County during the early afternoon.  Softball size hail was reported with this cell, causing significant damage south of the town of Allison.  The storms over southwest Iowa underwent a transition into more of a wind event.  High winds were reported in Cass County as the storms moved through the Griswold area.  By mid afternoon, the storms in southern Iowa had taken on a bow configuration.  As the storms moved through Adair County, very strong winds swept through the northeast part of the county.   The winds toppled power lines northeast of Greenfield.  As the storms continued east, the intensity decreased.

The dynamics were sufficient to overcome the shortcomings in moisture available for the system.  A cold front dropped southeast out of the Dakotas into Iowa during the afternoon.  Surface dew points were generally in the mid 50s ahead of the front, though a narrow ribbon of upper 50s to lower 60s was found just ahead of the front.  As the cold front dropped southeast, a very strong closed low at 500 mb was also dropping into the area.  This helped to destabilize the atmosphere as freezing levels fell to the 8000 to 10,000 foot range by evening.  A small area of thunderstorms developed by mid day over north central Iowa.  The storms intensified rapidly during the maximum heating of the day.  Thunderstorms fired southwest of the original area and became severe quickly.  For the most part the storms produced hail and small tornadoes.  The first tornado touched in Crawford County.  The county Emergency Manager reported seeing 7 funnel clouds and two brief touchdowns with the initial cell.  The tornadoes were all small and were only on the ground briefly.  Several other brief touchdowns occurred in the County before the storm moved east.  The strongest tornado touched down on the edge of the town of Denison.  A 14 x 50 metal building was destroyed.  A fire hydrant was damaged in the vicinity by flying debris.  It was reported that water could be seen being sucked out of the hydrant by the tornado.  The tornado threat shifted into northeast Iowa for the rest of the afternoon.  Several tornadoes touched down in Bremer, Butler, and Black Hawk Counties.  Most of these were quite small and did little damage however.  The longest track tornado touched down in the Janesville area of Bremer County and tracked over 8 miles to the east, lifting just east of the town of Denver.  The countryside is quite open between these two locations.  For this reason, damage was minimal as the tornado actually missed both of the towns.  With the cold air aloft, hail was a significant factor.  There were reports of at least half inch diameter hail with nearly all of the storms.  Numerous reports of hail of an inch up to golf ball size were received.  The storms produced three inch diameter hail on the north side of Belmond, causing significant damage to the area and reportedly covering the ground.  One of the storms became very intense over Butler County during the early afternoon.  Softball size hail was reported with this cell, causing significant damage south of the town of Allison.  The storms over southwest Iowa underwent a transition into more of a wind event.  High winds were reported in Cass County as the storms moved through the Griswold area.  By mid afternoon, the storms in southern Iowa had taken on a bow configuration.  As the storms moved through Adair County, very strong winds swept through the northeast part of the county.   The winds toppled power lines northeast of Greenfield.  As the storms continued east, the intensity decreased.  The storms still produced gusty winds, but speeds were generally in the 45 to 55 MPH range.",Brief touchdown in open country.,PDS

A survey of the debris and an eyewitness account also confirmed that a small F0 tornado touched down in Bellingham around 725 pm EDT.  The tornado was estimated to have a path length of 150 yards and a width of 80 yards.  Wind speeds were estimated near 70 mph.  There were no injuries.  Spotters reported hail as large as a half dollar prior to the wind damage.  As the storms progressed across Norfolk County, trees and power lines were downed in Sharon, Walpole, and Norwood.  Another severe thunderstorm later in the evening downed trees onto a road in Walpole and another on a house.The storms also contained frequent cloud-to-ground lightning.  Tens of thousands were left without power.  In Auburn, lightning caused two house fires when a nearby transformer was struck.  In Whitman, a house fire started by a lightning strike on the second floor.

There were many reports of damage to residential homes, businesses, and motor vehicles, caused by falling trees/branches. Maximum wind gusts were in the 64 to 78 knot range (74 to 90 mph) in parts of Sheboygan, Dodge, and Washington counties, and 50 to 63 knots (58 to 73 mph) elsewhere.  In addition, three (3) tornadoes formed in a meso low-pressure on the left side of a pronounced down-burst located on the leading edge of the squall line.  One of the tornadoes, rated F0, briefly affected the area southwest of the village of Marquette (Green Lake Co.).  Later on, the same meso-low-pressure/down-burst couplet generated a F1 tornado that affected the area north and east of Fox Lake (Dodge Co.).  The last tornado (F1) spun up near Rubicon (Dodge Co.) and moved southeast into Washington County, giving the city of Waterford a glancing blow.  Refer to individual narratives on these 3 tornadoes under the tornado events for June 11th. Significant county reports follow.Marquette County:  A tree fell on and damaged a home in Packwaukee. Near Westfield, ten (10) calf pens were destroyed.Green Lake County:  A brief tornado (F0) damaged a home, barn, and several trees about 3 miles southwest of Marquette.  In addition, near Dalton, two (2) barns were severely damaged by down-burst winds.Fond du Lac County:  a boat in the Fond du Lac harbor sustained wind damage.Sheboygan County:  Hurricane-force winds over-turned a barn four (4) miles north of Beechwood.Dodge County:  A F1 tornado traveled from a point 4 miles north of Fox Lake to 4 miles east of Fox Lake.  A tornado spun up near Rubicon and then moved southeast into Washington County just north of State Highway 60.  Along its path in Dodge County, only F0 damage was observed.  Elsewhere, in the village of Neosho, a residential home was damaged by felled trees. In a rural area near Hustisford, the roof of a home was partially ripped off and several farm outbuildings were damaged.Washington County:  The tornado that spun up near Rubicon (Dodge Co.) intensified to a F1 rating as it moved southeast through the southwest part of Hartford, before dissipating southeast of the city.  This tornado inflicted wind or tree damage to more than 250 residential homes and business. Waukesha County: Down-burst winds pushed over a barn near the village of Lannon.  Most of the tree and power-line damage was noted in the Oconomowoc to Waukesha area, and in the North Prairie to Eagle area.Milwaukee County: tree/power-line damage across much of county.  Several cars sustained damaged from felled trees.  Mitchell Field had a measured maximum wind gust of 60 knots (69 mph).  Lightning struck a Wauwatosa home, resulting in a roof/attic fire.As the squall line moved through south-central and southeast Wisconsin, heavy rains reduced visibilities to 100-200 feet at some locations.  Total rainfall for the event was impressive, and exceeded 2 inches in some spots. West Allis (Milwaukee Co.) registered 2.70 inches, Watertown (Jefferson Co.) and Janesville (Rock Co.) measured 2.64 inches, Madison's Truax Field came in with 1.94 inches, and Milwaukee Mitchell Field recorded 1.75 inches. Most small streams reached near-bankfull stages, and the Fox River at New Munster, in western Kenosha County, eventually exceeded its 10 foot flood stage by 2.25 feet early at 0000CST on June 14, 2001.The squall line was the tail extension of an intense bow-echo that struck the east-central Wisconsin counties of Waushara, Winnebago, Calumet, and Manitowoc with hurricane-force, down-burst winds.  Twenty-four hours earlier, the bow-echo/squall line was a cluster of thunderstorms over eastern Montana.  Synpotically, a warm front extended from central Minnesota to southwest Wisconsin to just south of Chicago.   Aloft, a 500mb short-wave trough moved east across North Dakota and then moved southeast across Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Strong warm-air advection between 850 and 700mb fueled the thunderstorm complex.","A tornado spun up 4 miles north of Fox Lake in northwest Dodge County, and moved southeast through the grounds of the Fox Lake State Correctional Institute, before dissipating 4 miles east of Fox Lake. At the Correctional Institute, the tornado bent several fence sections, cut off power, burst two water mains, and smashed windows in the recreation hall.  Security guards reported a ""lifting"" force and ""popping ears"" as the tornado passed overhead.  Northeast and east of Fox Lake, the tornado destroyed 2 barns, severely damaged a third barn, and damaged 1 home, 3 silos, and 2 pole sheds.  Although the maximum path width was 75 yards, the average path width was closer to 40 yards.",PDS

It hit during a lull of a golf tornament that was going on there, damaging the fourth hole of the course as well as destroying a metal fence around a tennis court. This tornado also demolished a storage building. This was ranked as an F1 Tornado, with winds estimated between 75 and 100 mph, by National Weather Service Personnel. The tornado also took out many trees around this area. The tornado lifted back up, but then reformed from the cell as the storm moved into the cities of Torrington and Winstead. This second tornado was ranked on the Fujita scale as an F2 with winds estimated between 100 and 130 mph. It touched down near the Torrington Middle School, over the Midget Football Field cutting a swath two hundred yards wide and a half a mile in length. The tornado destroyed an 8,000 dollar shed that had recently been completed by the Midget Football League. The second twister also demolished the  bleachers and part of a roof at the Torrington Middle school. In addition, hundreds of large trees were uprooted. Powerlines were also destroyed.

There were many reports of damage to residential homes, businesses, and motor vehicles, caused by falling trees/branches. Maximum wind gusts were in the 64 to 78 knot range (74 to 90 mph) in parts of Sheboygan, Dodge, and Washington counties, and 50 to 63 knots (58 to 73 mph) elsewhere.  In addition, three (3) tornadoes formed in a meso low-pressure on the left side of a pronounced down-burst located on the leading edge of the squall line.  One of the tornadoes, rated F0, briefly affected the area southwest of the village of Marquette (Green Lake Co.).  Later on, the same meso-low-pressure/down-burst couplet generated a F1 tornado that affected the area north and east of Fox Lake (Dodge Co.).  The last tornado (F1) spun up near Rubicon (Dodge Co.) and moved southeast into Washington County, giving the city of Waterford a glancing blow.  Refer to individual narratives on these 3 tornadoes under the tornado events for June 11th. Significant county reports follow.Marquette County:  A tree fell on and damaged a home in Packwaukee. Near Westfield, ten (10) calf pens were destroyed.Green Lake County:  A brief tornado (F0) damaged a home, barn, and several trees about 3 miles southwest of Marquette.  In addition, near Dalton, two (2) barns were severely damaged by down-burst winds.Fond du Lac County:  a boat in the Fond du Lac harbor sustained wind damage.Sheboygan County:  Hurricane-force winds over-turned a barn four (4) miles north of Beechwood.Dodge County:  A F1 tornado traveled from a point 4 miles north of Fox Lake to 4 miles east of Fox Lake.  A tornado spun up near Rubicon and then moved southeast into Washington County just north of State Highway 60.  Along its path in Dodge County, only F0 damage was observed.  Elsewhere, in the village of Neosho, a residential home was damaged by felled trees. In a rural area near Hustisford, the roof of a home was partially ripped off and several farm outbuildings were damaged.Washington County:  The tornado that spun up near Rubicon (Dodge Co.) intensified to a F1 rating as it moved southeast through the southwest part of Hartford, before dissipating southeast of the city.  This tornado inflicted wind or tree damage to more than 250 residential homes and business. Waukesha County: Down-burst winds pushed over a barn near the village of Lannon.  Most of the tree and power-line damage was noted in the Oconomowoc to Waukesha area, and in the North Prairie to Eagle area.Milwaukee County: tree/power-line damage across much of county.  Several cars sustained damaged from felled trees.  Mitchell Field had a measured maximum wind gust of 60 knots (69 mph).  Lightning struck a Wauwatosa home, resulting in a roof/attic fire.As the squall line moved through south-central and southeast Wisconsin, heavy rains reduced visibilities to 100-200 feet at some locations.  Total rainfall for the event was impressive, and exceeded 2 inches in some spots. West Allis (Milwaukee Co.) registered 2.70 inches, Watertown (Jefferson Co.) and Janesville (Rock Co.) measured 2.64 inches, Madison's Truax Field came in with 1.94 inches, and Milwaukee Mitchell Field recorded 1.75 inches. Most small streams reached near-bankfull stages, and the Fox River at New Munster, in western Kenosha County, eventually exceeded its 10 foot flood stage by 2.25 feet early at 0000CST on June 14, 2001.The squall line was the tail extension of an intense bow-echo that struck the east-central Wisconsin counties of Waushara, Winnebago, Calumet, and Manitowoc with hurricane-force, down-burst winds.  Twenty-four hours earlier, the bow-echo/squall line was a cluster of thunderstorms over eastern Montana.  Synpotically, a warm front extended from central Minnesota to southwest Wisconsin to just south of Chicago.   Aloft, a 500mb short-wave trough moved east across North Dakota and then moved southeast across Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Strong warm-air advection between 850 and 700mb fueled the thunderstorm complex.","A weak (F0) tornado spun up 1 mile north/northwest of Rubicon in southeast Dodge County, and moved southeast before exiting the county at a point 2 miles east/southeast of Rubicon.  While in Dodge County, it pulled down or uprooted many trees.  This tornado then moved through Washington County, giving a glancing blow to the city of Hartford.  Associated winds were in the 52 to 61 knot range (60 to 70 mph).",PDS

It hit during a lull of a golf tornament that was going on there, damaging the fourth hole of the course as well as destroying a metal fence around a tennis court. This tornado also demolished a storage building. This was ranked as an F1 Tornado, with winds estimated between 75 and 100 mph, by National Weather Service Personnel. The tornado also took out many trees around this area. The tornado lifted back up, but then reformed from the cell as the storm moved into the cities of Torrington and Winstead. This second tornado was ranked on the Fujita scale as an F2 with winds estimated between 100 and 130 mph. It touched down near the Torrington Middle School, over the Midget Football Field cutting a swath two hundred yards wide and a half a mile in length. The tornado destroyed an 8,000 dollar shed that had recently been completed by the Midget Football League.

A mesoscale vorticity maximum developed over the High Plains during the previous night and was located over northeast Nebraska during the morning of the 24th.  A complex of thunderstorms continued to move east into northwest Iowa.  As daytime heating continued, the storms became stronger and more organized.  The main product into the early afternoon hours was heavy rainfall.  During the early to mid afternoon hours, meso analysis clearly indicated the development of a surface low pressure system.  As the outflow, or meso cold front, dropped southeast into southern Iowa it encountered very rich air with dew points in the low 80s.  Thunderstorms developed explosively in central Iowa.  Within 15 to 20 minutes of initial development the storms became severe.  A tornado touched down in an open field in southern Polk County, about 5 miles south of West Des Moines.  The tornado was not well organized and did little damage.  Most of the storms that became severe produced high winds.  Winds of 65 MPH were reported in the Waterloo area.  One cell produced a wet microburst southeast of the city of Waterloo with winds around 80 MPH.  The high winds ripped the roof off of a house there, resulting in the house being toppled.  The storms left 2.29 inches of rain officially in the city, though some areas unofficially reported in excess of 8 inches.  Considerable urban flooding took place in the city of Waterloo, with flash flooding in the outlying areas.  Many basements were flooded as reports of standing water nearly 3 feet deep in the streets were received.  Earlier in the afternoon heavy rains fell in Webster City.  Upwards of 2 inches of rain fell in under an hour causing urban flooding in the city.  The water receded quickly after the rain stopped.  High winds were also reported in Story County in the Ames area.  A few reports of hail were received, but the hail was not all that large being as the freezing level was 15000 feet.  Nickle size hail fell in Waterloo and also in Windsor Heights.  After the initial fury of activity, the storms did not produce severe weather for a few hours.  As the storms continued to move east, they picked up in intensity again in the Ottumwa area.

In Charles County, a tornado touched down on Panda Court in the Hampshire Lake subdivision about 2.5 miles west of downtown Waldorf.  The tornado tracked northeast across the subdivisions of McDaniel Country Estates, Ashford Oaks, Streamview, and across Route 228 (Berry Road) before crossing into Prince George's County near Acton Lane.  The tornado was 100 yards wide and was ranked an F1.  Over 100 homes received minor damage to siding and roofs, with the most concentrated area of damage in the Streamview neighborhood.  The worst damage included trees putting significant holes into homes, damaged cars, broken windows, a damaged deck, and a downed chimney.  In addition, a shed, tractor, and air conditioning unit were blown over.  The survey team estimated over 100 trees and several power lines were downed in the path of the storm.  As the tornado crossed Route 228 it picked up a truck, spun it around and flipped it over onto the side of the road.  Just north of Route 228, the tornado destroyed three barns at a sod farm.  When the twister reached Acton Lane, it downed several trees and power lines.  About an hour before the tornado touched down near Waldorf, another thunderstorm produced a funnel cloud that apparently never reached the ground just northeast of Indian Head.  Pea sized hail was reported in Bryans Road.  In Prince George's County, the Green Acre Farms area about 4 miles southwest of Brandywine was hit by  the same tornado that damaged several homes just west of Waldorf.  The tornado crossed Mattawoman Creek at the county line near Acton Lane, then pushed northeast across the Green Acre Farms subdivision and Gardner Road.  Several trees were downed in the path of the twister.  Two homes in Green Acre Farms were damaged.  One of the homes on Gardner Road suffered water damage after a tree pushed in a basement door which allowed water runoff to flood the basement.  Another homeowner on Mattawoman Lane had a vehicle significantly damaged by a downed tree.  A nearby shed was picked up off its foundation and thrown 40 feet.  The path of the tornado was clearly visible as a tree top ""V"" pattern in the woodlands behind the home.  A nearby barn was also damaged.  Six occupants in 5 cars on nearby roadways had to be rescued after downed trees and power lines made the roads impassable.  The tornado dissipated in the woods just northeast of Gardner Road before reaching Robin Dale Country Club.  The storm that produced the tornado continued to move northeast across the county.

The associated surface cold front moved into East Central Iowa during peak heating.  Mid level cooling and strong surface heating created a moderately unstable airmass.  Speed and directional shear was also more than sufficient to spawn supercell thunderstorms near Waterloo, which moved east into Buchanan County producing several tornadoes.  Eventually, the activity evolved into a squall line which moved across much of the remainder of Eastern Iowa, Northwest and West Central Illinois and Northeast Missouri.  However, decreasing instability, coupled with the loss of daytime heating resulted in a gradual weakening of the storms and only a few severe reports. Here is a summary of the tornadoes which struck Buchanan and Delaware Counties:Buchanan County - 455 pm CDTAn F1 tornado touched down 2.5 miles north to northwest of Winthrop and lifted at 505 pm CDT approximately 2.25 miles north of Winthrop.  This tornado was on the ground for about 1 mile and was 150 yards wide.  This tornado produced the most severe damage from the entire event as it ripped through the Tempus farm site at 1846 Reed Avenue.  The Tempus home suffered minor damage with a few windows blown out and pieces of siding removed.  Several large outbuildings were totally destroyed, including a large machine shed, barn and an open faced cattle shed.  Seven head of cattle were killed with 15 to 20 head of cattle injured.  A large combine and several other pieces of farm equipment were damaged.  Buchanan County -  501 pm CDTAn F0 tornado touched down 1 mile south of Fairbank near Baxter Avenue and 120th Street.  This tornado produced no damage.  A National Weather Service Cooperative Observer reported seeing this tornado as a white thin cloud touching the ground, but not appearing to connect with the cloud base.  Hail also covered the ground about 4.7 miles south of Highway 281 on W13 and Amish Boulevard. Buchanan County - 506 pm CDTAn F0 tornado touched down one half mile southwest of Independence, just north of Highway 20 and west of Illinois Avenue.  This was a brief touchdown with no damage. Buchanan County - 506 pm CDTAn F0 tornado touched down 1 mile west of Independence and lifted on the east end of town at approximately 516 pm.  This tornado was on the ground for 3 miles and was 150 yards wide.  This tornado produced mainly tree damage.  A farm on the west side of Independence suffered minor damage to a grain elevator.  Several homes in Independence also suffered minor damage, mainly to shingles and siding.  Eyewitness reports indicated that a much broader rotation was associated with this tornado several hundred feet above the ground with possible multiple vortices. Buchanan County - 511 pm CDTAn F0 tornado touched down 2 miles southwest of Lamont near Taylor Avenue and 150th Street.  This was a brief touchdown with no damage reported.  Trained spotters observed this tornado as two smaller vortices, which merged together before lifting a short time later. Delaware County - 512 pm CDTAn F0 tornado touched down 2 miles northwest of Manchester.  This was a brief touchdown with no damage reported. Buchanan County - 529 pm CDTAn F0 tornado touched down 3.5 miles southeast of Winthrop near County Road W45 and 260th Street.  A hog confinement sustained minor damage and one older corn crib suffered damage.  Evidence of this tornado was visible in a field approaching the damage site as old corn stock debris was swept into a nearby fence.

There were many reports of damage to residential homes, businesses, and motor vehicles, caused by falling trees/branches. Maximum wind gusts were in the 64 to 78 knot range (74 to 90 mph) in parts of Sheboygan, Dodge, and Washington counties, and 50 to 63 knots (58 to 73 mph) elsewhere.  In addition, three (3) tornadoes formed in a meso low-pressure on the left side of a pronounced down-burst located on the leading edge of the squall line.  One of the tornadoes, rated F0, briefly affected the area southwest of the village of Marquette (Green Lake Co.).  Later on, the same meso-low-pressure/down-burst couplet generated a F1 tornado that affected the area north and east of Fox Lake (Dodge Co.).  The last tornado (F1) spun up near Rubicon (Dodge Co.) and moved southeast into Washington County, giving the city of Waterford a glancing blow.  Refer to individual narratives on these 3 tornadoes under the tornado events for June 11th. Significant county reports follow.Marquette County:  A tree fell on and damaged a home in Packwaukee. Near Westfield, ten (10) calf pens were destroyed.Green Lake County:  A brief tornado (F0) damaged a home, barn, and several trees about 3 miles southwest of Marquette.  In addition, near Dalton, two (2) barns were severely damaged by down-burst winds.Fond du Lac County:  a boat in the Fond du Lac harbor sustained wind damage.Sheboygan County:  Hurricane-force winds over-turned a barn four (4) miles north of Beechwood.Dodge County:  A F1 tornado traveled from a point 4 miles north of Fox Lake to 4 miles east of Fox Lake.  A tornado spun up near Rubicon and then moved southeast into Washington County just north of State Highway 60.  Along its path in Dodge County, only F0 damage was observed.  Elsewhere, in the village of Neosho, a residential home was damaged by felled trees. In a rural area near Hustisford, the roof of a home was partially ripped off and several farm outbuildings were damaged.Washington County:  The tornado that spun up near Rubicon (Dodge Co.) intensified to a F1 rating as it moved southeast through the southwest part of Hartford, before dissipating southeast of the city.  This tornado inflicted wind or tree damage to more than 250 residential homes and business. Waukesha County: Down-burst winds pushed over a barn near the village of Lannon.  Most of the tree and power-line damage was noted in the Oconomowoc to Waukesha area, and in the North Prairie to Eagle area.Milwaukee County: tree/power-line damage across much of county.  Several cars sustained damaged from felled trees.  Mitchell Field had a measured maximum wind gust of 60 knots (69 mph).  Lightning struck a Wauwatosa home, resulting in a roof/attic fire.As the squall line moved through south-central and southeast Wisconsin, heavy rains reduced visibilities to 100-200 feet at some locations.

West Allis (Milwaukee Co.) registered 2.70 inches, Watertown (Jefferson Co.) and Janesville (Rock Co.) measured 2.64 inches, Madison's Truax Field came in with 1.94 inches, and Milwaukee Mitchell Field recorded 1.75 inches.

Twenty-four hours earlier, the bow-echo/squall line was a cluster of thunderstorms over eastern Montana.  Synpotically, a warm front extended from central Minnesota to southwest Wisconsin to just south of Chicago.   Aloft, a 500mb short-wave trough moved east across North Dakota and then moved southeast across Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Ahead of this cold front, unseasonably warm air surged northward into the Great Lakes. Thunderstorms developed ahead of the cold front late in the afternoon of the 24th and continued into the evening. These thunderstorms extended from the Great Lakes all the way to the deep south. Strong winds just off the surface allowed some of the thunderstorms that developed across southern Michigan to become severe. Most of the severe storms caused damaging winds gusts associated with strait line microburst winds. However, increased low level directional shear via a surface warm front that extended across southeast Michigan allowed some of the thunderstorms to develop rotation, a few of which produced tornadoes. Three tornadoes were spawned from the thunderstorms. However, since two of the tornadoes crossed a county border, five tornadoes will officially be recorded with this event. This is considered an unusual event since tornadoes in late October in Southeast Michigan are extremely rare. Following the passage of the cold front early on the morning of the 25th, winds gusting as high as 45 MPH affected the region and dropped temperatures 20 to 30 degrees.",A brief tornado touchdown produced sporadic tree damage near the intersection of Bell and Bush Roads in Taymouth Township.,PDS

Ahead of the front the airmass became unstable as dew point temperatures rose into the mid 60s to low 70s.  Thunderstorm erupted over north central Iowa during the early afternoon as colder temperatures moved in aloft, destabilizing the atmosphere.  Surface based convection developed by mid to late afternoon over the central and southern counties of the state.  The main severe weather feature with the storms was hail ranging from one to two inches in diameter.  Two inch diameter hail broke out windows in cars north of Northwood in Worth County.  Southeast of Northwood, near Silver Lake, hail nearly baseball in size caused considerable damage to property and crops.  Hail was reported to be drifted 3 to 4 inches deep in places.  Two inch diameter hail also fell in Hancock County at Garner.  The storms over southern Iowa, being surface based, had a higher likelihood of becoming tornadic.  Indeed one of the storms did produce a brief tornado touchdown in Appanoose County northwest of Udell.  The tornado did little damage as it touched down in open country.

Ahead of this cold front, unseasonably warm air surged northward into the Great Lakes. Thunderstorms developed ahead of the cold front late in the afternoon of the 24th and continued into the evening. These thunderstorms extended from the Great Lakes all the way to the deep south. Strong winds just off the surface allowed some of the thunderstorms that developed across southern Michigan to become severe. Most of the severe storms caused damaging winds gusts associated with strait line microburst winds. However, increased low level directional shear via a surface warm front that extended across southeast Michigan allowed some of the thunderstorms to develop rotation, a few of which produced tornadoes. Three tornadoes were spawned from the thunderstorms. However, since two of the tornadoes crossed a county border, five tornadoes will officially be recorded with this event. This is considered an unusual event since tornadoes in late October in Southeast Michigan are extremely rare. Following the passage of the cold front early on the morning of the 25th, winds gusting as high as 45 MPH affected the region and dropped temperatures 20 to 30 degrees.","A tornado touched down 3.5 miles east of the town of Munger.

It grew to nearly 500 yards in width and moved toward the southeast for 1.2 miles across the airport and over the National Guard Armory before dissipating near the center of town. Although much of the damage was F0 and F1 on the Fujita Scale, the tornado was rated F2 because of the level of damage from the airport to the armory.  During this time it destroyed a large hangar, partially destroyed the roof and walls of the concrete Armory and moved numerous mobile homes off their pads.  One mobile home clearly showed the nature of damage from a tornado. The center of the mobile home was completely destroyed, along with a tree in front of it, while much less damage was indicted on both ends of the mobile home as well as vegetation near the ends.  The storm also knocked out power to much of the area, and this, along with the darkness in the late night hour, made spotting very difficult. It is possible that additional small tornadoes might have accompanied the storm, but the combination of damage from the large tornado and the downburst winds, along with the darkness of the late night hour made it impossible to tell. Almost 150 homes in Hondo and almost 50 more outside the city were damaged, with nearly 100 mobile homes damaged.   At least 10 houses and 30 mobile homes were destroyed.  Losses to homes and mobile homes were estimated at 1.5 million dollars.   In addition, nearly two dozen aircraft, including one corporate jet and 14 crop dusters, were damaged and destroyed at the Hondo Airport.  Some were in collapsed hangars while others were lifted, tossed and set down across the Airport area.  Commercial losses placed at 18 million dollars. At least 25 persons were injured.",PDS

Ahead of this cold front, unseasonably warm air surged northward into the Great Lakes. Thunderstorms developed ahead of the cold front late in the afternoon of the 24th and continued into the evening. These thunderstorms extended from the Great Lakes all the way to the deep south. Strong winds just off the surface allowed some of the thunderstorms that developed across southern Michigan to become severe. Most of the severe storms caused damaging winds gusts associated with strait line microburst winds. However, increased low level directional shear via a surface warm front that extended across southeast Michigan allowed some of the thunderstorms to develop rotation, a few of which produced tornadoes. Three tornadoes were spawned from the thunderstorms. However, since two of the tornadoes crossed a county border, five tornadoes will officially be recorded with this event. This is considered an unusual event since tornadoes in late October in Southeast Michigan are extremely rare. Following the passage of the cold front early on the morning of the 25th, winds gusting as high as 45 MPH affected the region and dropped temperatures 20 to 30 degrees.","A tornado touched down west of Hartland and moved east-northeast to the Oakland county line.

A warm front lifted north across the state during the day as a strong upper level disturbance approached from the west and northwest.  During the afternoon a cold front moved into northwest Iowa with a surface low forming along the front in that area.  Ahead of the front the airmass became unstable as dew point temperatures rose into the mid 60s to low 70s.  Thunderstorm erupted over north central Iowa during the early afternoon as colder temperatures moved in aloft, destabilizing the atmosphere.  Surface based convection developed by mid to late afternoon over the central and southern counties of the state.  The main severe weather feature with the storms was hail ranging from one to two inches in diameter.  Two inch diameter hail broke out windows in cars north of Northwood in Worth County.  Southeast of Northwood, near Silver Lake, hail nearly baseball in size caused considerable damage to property and crops.  Hail was reported to be drifted 3 to 4 inches deep in places.  Two inch diameter hail also fell in Hancock County at Garner.  The storms over southern Iowa, being surface based, had a higher likelihood of becoming tornadic.  Indeed one of the storms did produce a brief tornado touchdown in Appanoose County northwest of Udell.  The tornado did little damage as it touched down in open country.

The thunderstorms which spawned them were created when a strong cold front moved through the region.  One tornado touched down briefly in Orange County, just a few miles west of Gordonsville.  A resident saw the tornado come ""off the mountain"" and twist trees along Route 645 near the intersection of Route 33.  One tree landed on a vehicle near Route 33.  It is unknown exactly how long the twister was on the ground due to the rural nature of its path, so the path length of two tenths of a mile was estimated.  The damage path was about 25 yards wide and due to the amount of tree damage it was ranked an F1.  Shortly before the tornado touched down in Orange County, another storm produced a much stronger tornado over the northern half of Culpeper County.  The tornado was on the ground for 10 miles and touched down just east of Rixeyville on Route 640.  It was F0 strength at this location and downed a tree onto a home before moving northeast to Indian Fork Road.  On a hilltop at this location it destroyed all but the walkout basement of a two story brick house.  Debris from the home such as bricks and wood were impaled into the ground.  Plumbing and appliances were strewn across the yard and personal items such as clothing and bedding were found in trees at least 1/2 mile away.  A section of a deck was found intact 1/2 mile away and some insulation was discovered 6 miles from the site.  A car in the garage of the home was crushed by debris.  Fortunately, no one was home at the time the tornado hit.  A neighbor who witnessed the destruction said the home exploded like a bomb went off inside when the tornado ""dropped onto it"".  The tornado was ranked an F4 at this location with winds estimated around 210 MPH.  It weakened slightly as it moved northeast downing trees along a rural path south of Jeffersonton.  Next, it crossed through the heart of Jeffersonton along roughly Scottsville and Springs Roads at F2 strength.  Three trailer homes in the Ponderosa Trailer Court were destroyed, including one that was picked up and dropped in pieces 300 yards away.  Two people at the trailer park were injured, including one person who was hit in the back by flying debris while clinging to a pole outside.  Four churches, 4 trailer homes, 4 houses, and numerous trees and power lines were damaged in Jeffersonton.  Two barns and a garage attached to a home were destroyed.  The tornado continued to damage trees along its wooded path north of town before it crossed into Fauquier County.  The twister, now at F1 strength, remained on the ground for three more miles where it downed more trees and removed the roof of a barn.  The damage path crossed Hart Road and Holtzclaw Road, then it disappeared just north of Route 211.  The same storm dropped a second tornado in the northern portion of Fauquier County.  This tornado touched down southwest of The Plains just south of Interstate 66. Motorists saw it cross the interstate and push northeast toward Route 55.  At the intersection of Route 55 and Bunker Hill Road, the twister struck a home at F1 strength.  It ripped off the front porch, sending debris onto cars in the driveway.  It also destroyed a pool shed and damaged several trees.  The tornado crossed Route 55 where it downed trees and power poles and pushed over a tractor trailer.  The tornado weakened to F0 strength as it tracked north near Whitewood Road.  Two homes on Milestone Road and a few smaller buildings sustained minor damage.  A few trees were damaged as the tornado continued northward just west of Halfway.  The funnel dissipated before the storm crossed into Loudoun County.  Another thunderstorm dropped two tornadoes along the Interstate 95 and 395 corridor southwest of Washington D.C.  The first tornado touched down on Quantico Marine Corps Base just north of Garrisonville.  A funnel cloud was spotted near Garrisonville shortly before the twister touched down.  Trees were downed on the base along the path of the F0 tornado.  Personnel sited it as it passed a quarter mile west of the fire station.  The tornado continued north into Prince William County where it downed some trees in Prince William Forest Park area.  The tornado moved north into the Lake Montclair community where it took down a few trees, broke branches, and bent siding up on homes.  The weak tornado lifted shortly after.  Because the storm passed through several limited access areas, part of the tornado track was not able to be surveyed.  It is possible the tornado may not have been on the ground the entire time.The second tornado which remained on the ground for 15 miles passed through densely populated areas of Eastern Fairfax County, the western portion of the city of Alexandria, and Arlington County.  The F1 tornado touched down just west of Fort Belvoir near Newington Road in Fairfax County.  It skipped north-northeast through Kingstown and Franconia following Beulah Street (Route 613).  Minor damage was reported at the intersections of Windsor Avenue, Fleet Drive, and Walker Lane.  Several townhomes on Beulah Street received minor damage to roofing and siding.  Debris was also reported in the Franconia Commons development.  The tornado could be seen from the Franconia-Springfield metro station.  The next report of minor damage came from the Wellington Commons and Brookland Estates communities near the intersection of Franconia Road and Route 613.  Citywide, 10 homes received minor roof damage, two businesses sustained minor damage, and 40 trees and wires were downed.  Next, the twister crossed Eisenhower Road as it moved into the western portion of the City of Alexandria.  It weakened to F0 strength and was believed to have passed just west of Alexandria Hospital and into the Fort Ward Park area.  It downed a large sign on Interstate 395 at King Road.  Minor damage was reported in the Park Fairfax and Parc East communities along Martha Custis Drive near the Arlington County border.  The tornado returned to F1 strength and continued north-northeast paralleling Interstate 395 into the Shirlington portion of Arlington County.  It passed through the Arna Valley and Club Manor Estates developments near National Hospital Medical Center.  A woman walking down 28th Street in this area was injured when a tree branch fell onto her.  Nearby, windows were shattered at a restaurant.  The next concentrated area of damage occurred in the Virginia Highlands development between Kent and Ives Streets.  Several trees and wires were downed and a few house roofs sustained damage.  A weather observer at Reagan National Airport spotted the thin funnel as it moved from Crystal City over Pentagon City and across the 14th Street Bridge and reported a second funnel descending shortly before the tornado crossed the Potomac River.  The tornado moved across Interstate 395 just south of the Pentagon where it downed trees and road signs.  One woman was injured when a tree fell onto her vehicle.  Other vehicles received broken windows from flying debris.  The tornado started to weaken fast as it crossed the 14th Street Bridge into Washington D.C.  In addition to tornadoes, the storm produced very heavy downpours.  In Loudoun County, Town Branch in Leesburg overflowed its banks.  Several roads in low lying areas in and around town were also flooded including the Greenway at mile marker 8, Evergreen Mills Road, Loudoun Street, and the intersection of the Route 15 bypass at Sycolin Road.  Three water rescues were reported.  Street flooding was observed in Purcellville.  Rainfall reports included 4.1 to 4.8 inches in Leesburg, 3.95 inches in Lincoln and Purcellville, 3.9 inches in Ashburn, 2.60 inches in Middleburg, and 2.49 inches in Lovettsville.  In Fauquier County, Route 17 between Warrenton and Marshall was flooded.  Route 55 near Marshall was also covered with water.  Some secondary dirt roads in the northern portion of the county were partially washed out when small streams overflowed.  A total of 4.05 inches was recorded in The Plains and 2.14 inches fell in Warrenton.  In Culpeper County, 3.35 inches of rain fell in Culpeper.  In Madison County, rainfall totals included 2.80 inches in Hood, 2.77 inches at Fork Mountain, 2.65 inches in Wolftown, and 2.35 inches at Big Meadows.

One thunderstorm produced a devastating F3 tornado which was on the ground for 17.5 miles from College Park in Prince George's County to just east of Columbia in Howard County.  Multiple vortices were reported with the tornado at times.  The tornado first touched down in Northwest Branch Stream Valley Park just west of Hyattsville.  It rapidly strengthened to an F3 tornado with winds up to 200 MPH.  The damage path ranged in width from 100 to 200 yards.  The tornado crossed the intersection of Adelphi Road and University Boulevard into the western campus of the University of Maryland.  Ten trailers being used as a temporary office for the Maryland Fire and Rescue Institute were completely destroyed by the twister.  Debris from the trailers such as video tapes and pieces of paper were found up to 60 miles away in Northern Baltimore and Harford Counties in addition to extreme southeast Pennsylvania.  Four of the six people inside the trailers were injured, one seriously.  One staff member was thrown free of the destruction and was found in a dumpster nearby.  Another person dug their hands into the carpet and held on as their feet were being pulled up in the air by the tornado.  The other four occupants, including one child, took shelter under desks and survived.  Two University of Maryland students who were visiting their father who worked in the trailers left by car shortly before the tornado hit.  The two sisters, ages 20 and 23, were killed when the tornado picked up their car outside of Denton Hall and threw it either around or over an eight-story dorm.  They died instantly when their car crashed into a wooded area 300 yards from the road.  Most of the other buildings on the campus in the path of the storm were made of brick and suffered only minor to moderate damage, such as Denton Hall Dormitory, Easton Hall Dormitory and Dining Hall, and the President's Mansion.  A parking lot outside of Denton Hall full of cars was also hit by the tornado.  At least 200 vehicles in the parking lot were damaged, including at least 100 that were blown into and onto other vehicles.  At least twenty cars were totaled and one car was partially ripped apart.  The woods behind the parking lot were nearly flattened.  The bubble roof of the football practice facility near Byrd Stadium was removed.  Forty-eight people on campus, including 25 students, were injured by flying debris as the twister downed trees and ripped pieces of siding and roofing off buildings.  In addition, residential areas near the campus, including the University Courtyard Apartments sustained damage.  A total of 3000 students were left temporarily homeless after two dorms and an off-campus housing unit were evacuated due to storm damage.  During the recovery effort, a 78-year-old firefighter who responded to the tragedy at the University died of a heart attack shortly after returning from the scene. The tornado moved north-northeast off the campus and crossed University Boulevard at the intersection of Metzerott Road.  The steeple of a church was removed and cars were flipped near the intersection.  Power lines and trees were also downed.  The twister continued through Paint Branch Stream Valley Park where it downed numerous trees.   The tornado weakened to F2 strength before it crossed Interstate 95/495 just west of the Route 1 interchange.  It was remarkable that even though the highway was filled with bumper to bumper rush hour traffic, the only damage reported was a flipped tractor trailer.  The next area hit by the tornado was the community of Cherry Hill.  Several trees and power lines were downed onto roads and houses just west of Baltimore Avenue, including the Chestnut Hills subdivision.  Several businesses along Route 1 sustained minor damage, and three additional buildings lost portions of their roofs.  Three employees of a business in the Chestnut Hills Shopping Center were injured by flying glass after the windows on the front of the store were shattered.  The tornado moved across the National Agricultural Research Center and caused over $40 million dollars in damage.  Thirty greenhouses were damaged and several long term studies inside were destroyed.  Fifteen other buildings west of Route 1 suffered minor to moderate damage.  Numerous trees, including a row of historic willow oaks, were downed.  Over 65 vehicles in the employee parking lot were damaged by flying debris.  Eleven of these vehicles were totaled.  Just north of the research center, ""stunning"" tree and power line damage was reported at the intersection of Sellman and Montgomery Roads.  The tornado tracked across Powder Mill Road and ripped the roof off an office building at the intersection of Cedar Lane.  It continued across the Beltsville Heights development and caused damage to the roof at Martin Luther King Elementary School.  The tornado continued moving north-northeast toward Laurel.  The continuation of the damage path was located at the Virginia Manor Industrial Park on Van Dusen Road where several trees were downed.  The tornado was spotted as it moved past Laurel Hospital and it caused minor damage in the Village at Wellington subdivision nearby.  The next concentrated area of damage was found at Laurel High School.  An annex with 6 classrooms was heavily damaged.  The roof was ripped off three of the classrooms and three people inside the structure were injured by flying debris.  Significant damage was also reported to the athletic fields behind the school. The tornado moved northeast across the Fairlawn development where it damaged several homes.  One home on 10th Street was destroyed after the twister removed the roof and an outside wall.  On Montrose Avenue, a woman and her dog were briefly picked up by the tornado.  The woman sustained injuries to her hip and leg after being tossed 3 feet in the air and the dog landed uninjured.  The historic Harrison Building at the corner of 9th and Montgomery Streets lost its roof and a church and school nearby were damaged.  The tornado remained on the ground as it crossed the Patuxent River into Howard County.  Across Prince George's County, the tornado was responsible for $100 million in damage.  A total of 861 homes, 561 vehicles, and 23 businesses were damaged countywide.  In North Laurel, the twister heavily damaged a townhouse complex on Riverbrink Court in the Settlers Landing development.  A total of 43 townhomes were damaged, four of which were uninhabitable.  The tornado weakened to an F1 before it downed trees onto All Saints Road.  The tornado weakened to an F0 as it exited North Laurel and moved across Savage Park.  Isolated reports of downed trees were received in the community, including on Red Jacket Way, Vollmerhausen Road, and at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Route 32.  In its final stages, the tornado crossed the General Electric Appliance Park and downed its final tree at the intersection of Snowden River Parkway and Route 175 southeast of Columbia.In addition to the devastating tornado, the storms also produced very heavy rainfall and gusty winds.  In Anne Arundel County, strong winds from the tornadic thunderstorm downed 13 trees between Laurel and Maryland City.  In northern Carroll County, a bow echo produced damaging winds which downed trees along Bankard Road northwest of Union Mills.  Rainfall totals included 3.93 inches in Millers, 3.30 inches in Manchester, and 3.26 inches in Westminster.  In Montgomery County, 2 to 4 inches of rainfall across the western portion of the county caused low lying areas to quickly fill with water.  Several roads were flooded including River Road and Falls Road.  A motorist had to be rescued after their car stalled in high water in Poolsville.  A total of 3.61 inches of rainfall was recorded in Damascus.  In Howard County, between 2 and 3.75 inches of rain fell. A total of 2.86 inches was recorded in Columbia and 3.46 inches fell just southeast of the city.  In Frederick County, several roads were flooded by heavy downpours including Ball Road off Route 355 and New Design Road south of Adamstown Road.  Heavy rain downed trees at the intersection of Greenfield and Page Roads, Lingamore road and Gashouse Pike, Lawson Road and Route 75, and Bittle Road and Route 17.  Street flooding was also reported in Point of Rocks on Route 28. Rainfall totals included 2.54 inches in Wolfsville and 2.30 inches in Frederick.","A large multi-vortex tornado touched down near Hyattsville, tracked along the Route 1 cooridor from College Park to Laurel, then crossed into Howard County.

Nineteen tornadoes were confirmed, with three rated F3. The first F3 tornado developed in northeast Beckham County, near Elk City, and tracked northeastward for 11 miles before dissipating. As the tornado entered Custer County, a home of wood frame with brick exterior had most of its interior and exterior walls destroyed. The tornado then continued across an unpopulated area, causing major damage to trees and fences, before dissipating 2.5 miles west of Foss Dam. The second F3 tornado developed in Washita County, near Cordell. The Oklahoma State Emergency Management Office estimated that 477 single-family homes were damaged, 132 considered uninhabitable. In addition, 40 businesses were damaged, 22 considered uninhabitable. Damage was estimated near 100 million dollars, and nine injuries were reported. The last F3 tornado developed in Kiowa County and produced F3 damage soon after entering Washita County. Several vehicles and large pieces of farm equipment were tossed and destroyed. About 4 miles north-northeast of Mountain View, 3 homes suffered major damage, with one rated F3. As the tornado continued northeastward, F3 damage was inflicted on a farm, where a house and several barns and outbuildings were leveled. A 10,000 gallon diesel tank ended up in an open field about one-quarter mile away from its original position.For simplicity, the tornadoes that occurred on this day were identified by the supercell thunderstorm that produced them, beginning with A and ending with E. Each tornado was then given its own number. For example, the 3rd tornado produced by supercell thunderstorm A is called A3. In addition, some tornadoes tracked across multiple counties.",A3.

Ahead of this cold front, unseasonably warm air surged northward into the Great Lakes. Thunderstorms developed ahead of the cold front late in the afternoon of the 24th and continued into the evening. These thunderstorms extended from the Great Lakes all the way to the deep south. Strong winds just off the surface allowed some of the thunderstorms that developed across southern Michigan to become severe. Most of the severe storms caused damaging winds gusts associated with strait line microburst winds. However, increased low level directional shear via a surface warm front that extended across southeast Michigan allowed some of the thunderstorms to develop rotation, a few of which produced tornadoes. Three tornadoes were spawned from the thunderstorms. However, since two of the tornadoes crossed a county border, five tornadoes will officially be recorded with this event. This is considered an unusual event since tornadoes in late October in Southeast Michigan are extremely rare. Following the passage of the cold front early on the morning of the 25th, winds gusting as high as 45 MPH affected the region and dropped temperatures 20 to 30 degrees.","The Livingston County tornado moved into Oakland County near Clyde Rd in Highland Township. The tornado moved northeast and hit the small community of Davisburg in Springfield Township. Extensive damage occurred to the eastern portion of the Davisburg Elementary School. Four classrooms were completely destroyed and eight others were heavily damaged. The tornado struck the school after hours and while no after school extra curricular activities were going on. Therefore, the only people in the school at the time the tornado hit were two custodians, who were uninjured. Outside of the elementary school, some of the brick work on the outside of the Davisburg Candle Factory building was damaged, several homes sustained damage to their siding and shingles, and a tractor and horse trailer were overturned at a ranch just outside of town. Outside of the Davisburg area, broken and uprooted trees were the only other damage witnessed along the path of the tornado.",PDS

One thunderstorm produced a devastating F3 tornado which was on the ground for 17.5 miles from College Park in Prince George's County to just east of Columbia in Howard County.  Multiple vortices were reported with the tornado at times.  The tornado first touched down in Northwest Branch Stream Valley Park just west of Hyattsville.  It rapidly strengthened to an F3 tornado with winds up to 200 MPH.  The damage path ranged in width from 100 to 200 yards.  The tornado crossed the intersection of Adelphi Road and University Boulevard into the western campus of the University of Maryland.  Ten trailers being used as a temporary office for the Maryland Fire and Rescue Institute were completely destroyed by the twister.  Debris from the trailers such as video tapes and pieces of paper were found up to 60 miles away in Northern Baltimore and Harford Counties in addition to extreme southeast Pennsylvania.  Four of the six people inside the trailers were injured, one seriously.  One staff member was thrown free of the destruction and was found in a dumpster nearby.  Another person dug their hands into the carpet and held on as their feet were being pulled up in the air by the tornado.  The other four occupants, including one child, took shelter under desks and survived.  Two University of Maryland students who were visiting their father who worked in the trailers left by car shortly before the tornado hit.  The two sisters, ages 20 and 23, were killed when the tornado picked up their car outside of Denton Hall and threw it either around or over an eight-story dorm.  They died instantly when their car crashed into a wooded area 300 yards from the road.  Most of the other buildings on the campus in the path of the storm were made of brick and suffered only minor to moderate damage, such as Denton Hall Dormitory, Easton Hall Dormitory and Dining Hall, and the President's Mansion.  A parking lot outside of Denton Hall full of cars was also hit by the tornado.  At least 200 vehicles in the parking lot were damaged, including at least 100 that were blown into and onto other vehicles.  At least twenty cars were totaled and one car was partially ripped apart.  The woods behind the parking lot were nearly flattened.  The bubble roof of the football practice facility near Byrd Stadium was removed.  Forty-eight people on campus, including 25 students, were injured by flying debris as the twister downed trees and ripped pieces of siding and roofing off buildings.  In addition, residential areas near the campus, including the University Courtyard Apartments sustained damage.  A total of 3000 students were left temporarily homeless after two dorms and an off-campus housing unit were evacuated due to storm damage.  During the recovery effort, a 78-year-old firefighter who responded to the tragedy at the University died of a heart attack shortly after returning from the scene. The tornado moved north-northeast off the campus and crossed University Boulevard at the intersection of Metzerott Road.  The steeple of a church was removed and cars were flipped near the intersection.  Power lines and trees were also downed.  The twister continued through Paint Branch Stream Valley Park where it downed numerous trees.   The tornado weakened to F2 strength before it crossed Interstate 95/495 just west of the Route 1 interchange.  It was remarkable that even though the highway was filled with bumper to bumper rush hour traffic, the only damage reported was a flipped tractor trailer.  The next area hit by the tornado was the community of Cherry Hill.  Several trees and power lines were downed onto roads and houses just west of Baltimore Avenue, including the Chestnut Hills subdivision.  Several businesses along Route 1 sustained minor damage, and three additional buildings lost portions of their roofs.  Three employees of a business in the Chestnut Hills Shopping Center were injured by flying glass after the windows on the front of the store were shattered.  The tornado moved across the National Agricultural Research Center and caused over $40 million dollars in damage.  Thirty greenhouses were damaged and several long term studies inside were destroyed.  Fifteen other buildings west of Route 1 suffered minor to moderate damage.  Numerous trees, including a row of historic willow oaks, were downed.  Over 65 vehicles in the employee parking lot were damaged by flying debris.  Eleven of these vehicles were totaled.  Just north of the research center, ""stunning"" tree and power line damage was reported at the intersection of Sellman and Montgomery Roads.  The tornado tracked across Powder Mill Road and ripped the roof off an office building at the intersection of Cedar Lane.  It continued across the Beltsville Heights development and caused damage to the roof at Martin Luther King Elementary School.  The tornado continued moving north-northeast toward Laurel.  The continuation of the damage path was located at the Virginia Manor Industrial Park on Van Dusen Road where several trees were downed.  The tornado was spotted as it moved past Laurel Hospital and it caused minor damage in the Village at Wellington subdivision nearby.  The next concentrated area of damage was found at Laurel High School.  An annex with 6 classrooms was heavily damaged.  The roof was ripped off three of the classrooms and three people inside the structure were injured by flying debris.  Significant damage was also reported to the athletic fields behind the school. The tornado moved northeast across the Fairlawn development where it damaged several homes.  One home on 10th Street was destroyed after the twister removed the roof and an outside wall.  On Montrose Avenue, a woman and her dog were briefly picked up by the tornado.  The woman sustained injuries to her hip and leg after being tossed 3 feet in the air and the dog landed uninjured.  The historic Harrison Building at the corner of 9th and Montgomery Streets lost its roof and a church and school nearby were damaged.  The tornado remained on the ground as it crossed the Patuxent River into Howard County.  Across Prince George's County, the tornado was responsible for $100 million in damage.  A total of 861 homes, 561 vehicles, and 23 businesses were damaged countywide.  In North Laurel, the twister heavily damaged a townhouse complex on Riverbrink Court in the Settlers Landing development.  A total of 43 townhomes were damaged, four of which were uninhabitable.  The tornado weakened to an F1 before it downed trees onto All Saints Road.  The tornado weakened to an F0 as it exited North Laurel and moved across Savage Park.  Isolated reports of downed trees were received in the community, including on Red Jacket Way, Vollmerhausen Road, and at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Route 32.  In its final stages, the tornado crossed the General Electric Appliance Park and downed its final tree at the intersection of Snowden River Parkway and Route 175 southeast of Columbia.In addition to the devastating tornado, the storms also produced very heavy rainfall and gusty winds.  In Anne Arundel County, strong winds from the tornadic thunderstorm downed 13 trees between Laurel and Maryland City.  In northern Carroll County, a bow echo produced damaging winds which downed trees along Bankard Road northwest of Union Mills.  Rainfall totals included 3.93 inches in Millers, 3.30 inches in Manchester, and 3.26 inches in Westminster.  In Montgomery County, 2 to 4 inches of rainfall across the western portion of the county caused low lying areas to quickly fill with water.  Several roads were flooded including River Road and Falls Road.  A motorist had to be rescued after their car stalled in high water in Poolsville.  A total of 3.61 inches of rainfall was recorded in Damascus.  In Howard County, between 2 and 3.75 inches of rain fell. A total of 2.86 inches was recorded in Columbia and 3.46 inches fell just southeast of the city.  In Frederick County, several roads were flooded by heavy downpours including Ball Road off Route 355 and New Design Road south of Adamstown Road.  Heavy rain downed trees at the intersection of Greenfield and Page Roads, Lingamore road and Gashouse Pike, Lawson Road and Route 75, and Bittle Road and Route 17.  Street flooding was also reported in Point of Rocks on Route 28. Rainfall totals included 2.54 inches in Wolfsville and 2.30 inches in Frederick.",A tornado crossed into Howard County from Laurel and remained on the ground until it dissipated about 1 mile east of Columbia.  Several townhomes in North Laurel were damaged and trees were downed along the remainder of its path.,PDS

Ahead of this cold front, unseasonably warm air surged northward into the Great Lakes. Thunderstorms developed ahead of the cold front late in the afternoon of the 24th and continued into the evening. These thunderstorms extended from the Great Lakes all the way to the deep south. Strong winds just off the surface allowed some of the thunderstorms that developed across southern Michigan to become severe. Most of the severe storms caused damaging winds gusts associated with strait line microburst winds. However, increased low level directional shear via a surface warm front that extended across southeast Michigan allowed some of the thunderstorms to develop rotation, a few of which produced tornadoes. Three tornadoes were spawned from the thunderstorms. However, since two of the tornadoes crossed a county border, five tornadoes will officially be recorded with this event. This is considered an unusual event since tornadoes in late October in Southeast Michigan are extremely rare. Following the passage of the cold front early on the morning of the 25th, winds gusting as high as 45 MPH affected the region and dropped temperatures 20 to 30 degrees.","The Bay County tornado moved into Tuscola County near Darbee Road in Gilford Township.

Within an hour of the initial thunderstorm development, the first tornado set down southwest of Saronville in Clay county. This rope-like tornado was witnessed by many people, including numerous storm chasers, in Clay county.  The tornado drifted slowly south across farmland and damaged two pivots and did some minor crop damage.The second tornado, which was rated an F3, was on the ground for about 30 minutes.  The tornado basically followed state highway 74 from north of Edgar in southeast Clay county, to northwest of Shickley in far southwest Fillmore county.  Along its path, 14 irrigation pivots were destroyed, at least 15 grain bins were lost and two farmsteads sustained extensive damage.  One farmhouse was deemed a total loss, while another incurred broken windows, damaged siding and minor roof damage.

The thunderstorms which spawned them were created when a strong cold front moved through the region.  One tornado touched down briefly in Orange County, just a few miles west of Gordonsville.  A resident saw the tornado come ""off the mountain"" and twist trees along Route 645 near the intersection of Route 33.  One tree landed on a vehicle near Route 33.  It is unknown exactly how long the twister was on the ground due to the rural nature of its path, so the path length of two tenths of a mile was estimated.  The damage path was about 25 yards wide and due to the amount of tree damage it was ranked an F1.  Shortly before the tornado touched down in Orange County, another storm produced a much stronger tornado over the northern half of Culpeper County.  The tornado was on the ground for 10 miles and touched down just east of Rixeyville on Route 640.  It was F0 strength at this location and downed a tree onto a home before moving northeast to Indian Fork Road.  On a hilltop at this location it destroyed all but the walkout basement of a two story brick house.  Debris from the home such as bricks and wood were impaled into the ground.  Plumbing and appliances were strewn across the yard and personal items such as clothing and bedding were found in trees at least 1/2 mile away.  A section of a deck was found intact 1/2 mile away and some insulation was discovered 6 miles from the site.  A car in the garage of the home was crushed by debris.  Fortunately, no one was home at the time the tornado hit.  A neighbor who witnessed the destruction said the home exploded like a bomb went off inside when the tornado ""dropped onto it"".  The tornado was ranked an F4 at this location with winds estimated around 210 MPH.  It weakened slightly as it moved northeast downing trees along a rural path south of Jeffersonton.  Next, it crossed through the heart of Jeffersonton along roughly Scottsville and Springs Roads at F2 strength.  Three trailer homes in the Ponderosa Trailer Court were destroyed, including one that was picked up and dropped in pieces 300 yards away.  Two people at the trailer park were injured, including one person who was hit in the back by flying debris while clinging to a pole outside.  Four churches, 4 trailer homes, 4 houses, and numerous trees and power lines were damaged in Jeffersonton.  Two barns and a garage attached to a home were destroyed.  The tornado continued to damage trees along its wooded path north of town before it crossed into Fauquier County.  The twister, now at F1 strength, remained on the ground for three more miles where it downed more trees and removed the roof of a barn.  The damage path crossed Hart Road and Holtzclaw Road, then it disappeared just north of Route 211.  The same storm dropped a second tornado in the northern portion of Fauquier County.  This tornado touched down southwest of The Plains just south of Interstate 66. Motorists saw it cross the interstate and push northeast toward Route 55.  At the intersection of Route 55 and Bunker Hill Road, the twister struck a home at F1 strength.  It ripped off the front porch, sending debris onto cars in the driveway.  It also destroyed a pool shed and damaged several trees.  The tornado crossed Route 55 where it downed trees and power poles and pushed over a tractor trailer.  The tornado weakened to F0 strength as it tracked north near Whitewood Road.  Two homes on Milestone Road and a few smaller buildings sustained minor damage.  A few trees were damaged as the tornado continued northward just west of Halfway.  The funnel dissipated before the storm crossed into Loudoun County.  Another thunderstorm dropped two tornadoes along the Interstate 95 and 395 corridor southwest of Washington D.C.  The first tornado touched down on Quantico Marine Corps Base just north of Garrisonville.  A funnel cloud was spotted near Garrisonville shortly before the twister touched down.  Trees were downed on the base along the path of the F0 tornado.  Personnel sited it as it passed a quarter mile west of the fire station.  The tornado continued north into Prince William County where it downed some trees in Prince William Forest Park area.  The tornado moved north into the Lake Montclair community where it took down a few trees, broke branches, and bent siding up on homes.  The weak tornado lifted shortly after.  Because the storm passed through several limited access areas, part of the tornado track was not able to be surveyed.  It is possible the tornado may not have been on the ground the entire time.The second tornado which remained on the ground for 15 miles passed through densely populated areas of Eastern Fairfax County, the western portion of the city of Alexandria, and Arlington County.  The F1 tornado touched down just west of Fort Belvoir near Newington Road in Fairfax County.  It skipped north-northeast through Kingstown and Franconia following Beulah Street (Route 613).  Minor damage was reported at the intersections of Windsor Avenue, Fleet Drive, and Walker Lane.  Several townhomes on Beulah Street received minor damage to roofing and siding.  Debris was also reported in the Franconia Commons development.  The tornado could be seen from the Franconia-Springfield metro station.  The next report of minor damage came from the Wellington Commons and Brookland Estates communities near the intersection of Franconia Road and Route 613.  Citywide, 10 homes received minor roof damage, two businesses sustained minor damage, and 40 trees and wires were downed.  Next, the twister crossed Eisenhower Road as it moved into the western portion of the City of Alexandria.  It weakened to F0 strength and was believed to have passed just west of Alexandria Hospital and into the Fort Ward Park area.  It downed a large sign on Interstate 395 at King Road.  Minor damage was reported in the Park Fairfax and Parc East communities along Martha Custis Drive near the Arlington County border.  The tornado returned to F1 strength and continued north-northeast paralleling Interstate 395 into the Shirlington portion of Arlington County.  It passed through the Arna Valley and Club Manor Estates developments near National Hospital Medical Center.  A woman walking down 28th Street in this area was injured when a tree branch fell onto her.  Nearby, windows were shattered at a restaurant.  The next concentrated area of damage occurred in the Virginia Highlands development between Kent and Ives Streets.  Several trees and wires were downed and a few house roofs sustained damage.  A weather observer at Reagan National Airport spotted the thin funnel as it moved from Crystal City over Pentagon City and across the 14th Street Bridge and reported a second funnel descending shortly before the tornado crossed the Potomac River.  The tornado moved across Interstate 395 just south of the Pentagon where it downed trees and road signs.  One woman was injured when a tree fell onto her vehicle.  Other vehicles received broken windows from flying debris.  The tornado started to weaken fast as it crossed the 14th Street Bridge into Washington D.C.  In addition to tornadoes, the storm produced very heavy downpours.  In Loudoun County, Town Branch in Leesburg overflowed its banks.  Several roads in low lying areas in and around town were also flooded including the Greenway at mile marker 8, Evergreen Mills Road, Loudoun Street, and the intersection of the Route 15 bypass at Sycolin Road.  Three water rescues were reported.  Street flooding was observed in Purcellville.  Rainfall reports included 4.1 to 4.8 inches in Leesburg, 3.95 inches in Lincoln and Purcellville, 3.9 inches in Ashburn, 2.60 inches in Middleburg, and 2.49 inches in Lovettsville.  In Fauquier County, Route 17 between Warrenton and Marshall was flooded.  Route 55 near Marshall was also covered with water.  Some secondary dirt roads in the northern portion of the county were partially washed out when small streams overflowed.  A total of 4.05 inches was recorded in The Plains and 2.14 inches fell in Warrenton.  In Culpeper County, 3.35 inches of rain fell in Culpeper.  In Madison County, rainfall totals included 2.80 inches in Hood, 2.77 inches at Fork Mountain, 2.65 inches in Wolftown, and 2.35 inches at Big Meadows. In Rappahannock County, 3.75 inches was reported in Castleton.","A tornado from Alexandria moved just east of Interstate 395 from Shirlington to Pentagon City before it crossed the 14th Street bridge into D.C.

The thunderstorms which spawned them were created when a strong cold front moved through the region.  One tornado touched down briefly in Orange County, just a few miles west of Gordonsville.  A resident saw the tornado come ""off the mountain"" and twist trees along Route 645 near the intersection of Route 33.  One tree landed on a vehicle near Route 33.  It is unknown exactly how long the twister was on the ground due to the rural nature of its path, so the path length of two tenths of a mile was estimated.  The damage path was about 25 yards wide and due to the amount of tree damage it was ranked an F1.  Shortly before the tornado touched down in Orange County, another storm produced a much stronger tornado over the northern half of Culpeper County.  The tornado was on the ground for 10 miles and touched down just east of Rixeyville on Route 640.  It was F0 strength at this location and downed a tree onto a home before moving northeast to Indian Fork Road.  On a hilltop at this location it destroyed all but the walkout basement of a two story brick house.  Debris from the home such as bricks and wood were impaled into the ground.  Plumbing and appliances were strewn across the yard and personal items such as clothing and bedding were found in trees at least 1/2 mile away.  A section of a deck was found intact 1/2 mile away and some insulation was discovered 6 miles from the site.  A car in the garage of the home was crushed by debris.  Fortunately, no one was home at the time the tornado hit.  A neighbor who witnessed the destruction said the home exploded like a bomb went off inside when the tornado ""dropped onto it"".  The tornado was ranked an F4 at this location with winds estimated around 210 MPH.  It weakened slightly as it moved northeast downing trees along a rural path south of Jeffersonton.  Next, it crossed through the heart of Jeffersonton along roughly Scottsville and Springs Roads at F2 strength.  Three trailer homes in the Ponderosa Trailer Court were destroyed, including one that was picked up and dropped in pieces 300 yards away.  Two people at the trailer park were injured, including one person who was hit in the back by flying debris while clinging to a pole outside.  Four churches, 4 trailer homes, 4 houses, and numerous trees and power lines were damaged in Jeffersonton.  Two barns and a garage attached to a home were destroyed.  The tornado continued to damage trees along its wooded path north of town before it crossed into Fauquier County.  The twister, now at F1 strength, remained on the ground for three more miles where it downed more trees and removed the roof of a barn.  The damage path crossed Hart Road and Holtzclaw Road, then it disappeared just north of Route 211.  The same storm dropped a second tornado in the northern portion of Fauquier County.  This tornado touched down southwest of The Plains just south of Interstate 66. Motorists saw it cross the interstate and push northeast toward Route 55.  At the intersection of Route 55 and Bunker Hill Road, the twister struck a home at F1 strength.  It ripped off the front porch, sending debris onto cars in the driveway.  It also destroyed a pool shed and damaged several trees.  The tornado crossed Route 55 where it downed trees and power poles and pushed over a tractor trailer.  The tornado weakened to F0 strength as it tracked north near Whitewood Road.  Two homes on Milestone Road and a few smaller buildings sustained minor damage.  A few trees were damaged as the tornado continued northward just west of Halfway.  The funnel dissipated before the storm crossed into Loudoun County.  Another thunderstorm dropped two tornadoes along the Interstate 95 and 395 corridor southwest of Washington D.C.  The first tornado touched down on Quantico Marine Corps Base just north of Garrisonville.  A funnel cloud was spotted near Garrisonville shortly before the twister touched down.  Trees were downed on the base along the path of the F0 tornado.  Personnel sited it as it passed a quarter mile west of the fire station.  The tornado continued north into Prince William County where it downed some trees in Prince William Forest Park area.  The tornado moved north into the Lake Montclair community where it took down a few trees, broke branches, and bent siding up on homes.  The weak tornado lifted shortly after.  Because the storm passed through several limited access areas, part of the tornado track was not able to be surveyed.  It is possible the tornado may not have been on the ground the entire time.The second tornado which remained on the ground for 15 miles passed through densely populated areas of Eastern Fairfax County, the western portion of the city of Alexandria, and Arlington County.  The F1 tornado touched down just west of Fort Belvoir near Newington Road in Fairfax County.  It skipped north-northeast through Kingstown and Franconia following Beulah Street (Route 613).  Minor damage was reported at the intersections of Windsor Avenue, Fleet Drive, and Walker Lane.  Several townhomes on Beulah Street received minor damage to roofing and siding.  Debris was also reported in the Franconia Commons development.  The tornado could be seen from the Franconia-Springfield metro station.  The next report of minor damage came from the Wellington Commons and Brookland Estates communities near the intersection of Franconia Road and Route 613.  Citywide, 10 homes received minor roof damage, two businesses sustained minor damage, and 40 trees and wires were downed.  Next, the twister crossed Eisenhower Road as it moved into the western portion of the City of Alexandria.  It weakened to F0 strength and was believed to have passed just west of Alexandria Hospital and into the Fort Ward Park area.  It downed a large sign on Interstate 395 at King Road.  Minor damage was reported in the Park Fairfax and Parc East communities along Martha Custis Drive near the Arlington County border.  The tornado returned to F1 strength and continued north-northeast paralleling Interstate 395 into the Shirlington portion of Arlington County.  It passed through the Arna Valley and Club Manor Estates developments near National Hospital Medical Center.  A woman walking down 28th Street in this area was injured when a tree branch fell onto her.  Nearby, windows were shattered at a restaurant.  The next concentrated area of damage occurred in the Virginia Highlands development between Kent and Ives Streets.  Several trees and wires were downed and a few house roofs sustained damage.  A weather observer at Reagan National Airport spotted the thin funnel as it moved from Crystal City over Pentagon City and across the 14th Street Bridge and reported a second funnel descending shortly before the tornado crossed the Potomac River.  The tornado moved across Interstate 395 just south of the Pentagon where it downed trees and road signs.  One woman was injured when a tree fell onto her vehicle.  Other vehicles received broken windows from flying debris.  The tornado started to weaken fast as it crossed the 14th Street Bridge into Washington D.C.  In addition to tornadoes, the storm produced very heavy downpours.  In Loudoun County, Town Branch in Leesburg overflowed its banks.  Several roads in low lying areas in and around town were also flooded including the Greenway at mile marker 8, Evergreen Mills Road, Loudoun Street, and the intersection of the Route 15 bypass at Sycolin Road.

Next, the twister crossed Eisenhower Road as it moved into the western portion of the City of Alexandria.  It weakened to F0 strength and was believed to have passed just west of Alexandria Hospital and into the Fort Ward Park area.  It downed a large sign on Interstate 395 at King Road.  Minor damage was reported in the Park Fairfax and Parc East communities along Martha Custis Drive near the Arlington County border.  The tornado returned to F1 strength and continued north-northeast paralleling Interstate 395 into the Shirlington portion of Arlington County.  It passed through the Arna Valley and Club Manor Estates developments near National Hospital Medical Center.  A woman walking down 28th Street in this area was injured when a tree branch fell onto her.  Nearby, windows were shattered at a restaurant.  The next concentrated area of damage occurred in the Virginia Highlands development between Kent and Ives Streets.  Several trees and wires were downed and a few house roofs sustained damage.

The tornado moved across Interstate 395 just south of the Pentagon where it downed trees and road signs.  One woman was injured when a tree fell onto her vehicle.  Other vehicles received broken windows from flying debris.  The tornado started to weaken fast as it crossed the 14th Street Bridge into Washington D.C.  In addition to tornadoes, the storm produced very heavy downpours.  In Loudoun County, Town Branch in Leesburg overflowed its banks.

The thunderstorms which spawned them were created when a strong cold front moved through the region.  One tornado touched down briefly in Orange County, just a few miles west of Gordonsville.  A resident saw the tornado come ""off the mountain"" and twist trees along Route 645 near the intersection of Route 33.  One tree landed on a vehicle near Route 33.  It is unknown exactly how long the twister was on the ground due to the rural nature of its path, so the path length of two tenths of a mile was estimated.  The damage path was about 25 yards wide and due to the amount of tree damage it was ranked an F1.  Shortly before the tornado touched down in Orange County, another storm produced a much stronger tornado over the northern half of Culpeper County.  The tornado was on the ground for 10 miles and touched down just east of Rixeyville on Route 640.  It was F0 strength at this location and downed a tree onto a home before moving northeast to Indian Fork Road.  On a hilltop at this location it destroyed all but the walkout basement of a two story brick house.  Debris from the home such as bricks and wood were impaled into the ground.  Plumbing and appliances were strewn across the yard and personal items such as clothing and bedding were found in trees at least 1/2 mile away.  A section of a deck was found intact 1/2 mile away and some insulation was discovered 6 miles from the site.  A car in the garage of the home was crushed by debris.  Fortunately, no one was home at the time the tornado hit.  A neighbor who witnessed the destruction said the home exploded like a bomb went off inside when the tornado ""dropped onto it"".  The tornado was ranked an F4 at this location with winds estimated around 210 MPH.  It weakened slightly as it moved northeast downing trees along a rural path south of Jeffersonton.  Next, it crossed through the heart of Jeffersonton along roughly Scottsville and Springs Roads at F2 strength.  Three trailer homes in the Ponderosa Trailer Court were destroyed, including one that was picked up and dropped in pieces 300 yards away.  Two people at the trailer park were injured, including one person who was hit in the back by flying debris while clinging to a pole outside.  Four churches, 4 trailer homes, 4 houses, and numerous trees and power lines were damaged in Jeffersonton.  Two barns and a garage attached to a home were destroyed.  The tornado continued to damage trees along its wooded path north of town before it crossed into Fauquier County.  The twister, now at F1 strength, remained on the ground for three more miles where it downed more trees and removed the roof of a barn.  The damage path crossed Hart Road and Holtzclaw Road, then it disappeared just north of Route 211.  The same storm dropped a second tornado in the northern portion of Fauquier County.  This tornado touched down southwest of The Plains just south of Interstate 66. Motorists saw it cross the interstate and push northeast toward Route 55.  At the intersection of Route 55 and Bunker Hill Road, the twister struck a home at F1 strength.  It ripped off the front porch, sending debris onto cars in the driveway.  It also destroyed a pool shed and damaged several trees.  The tornado crossed Route 55 where it downed trees and power poles and pushed over a tractor trailer.  The tornado weakened to F0 strength as it tracked north near Whitewood Road.  Two homes on Milestone Road and a few smaller buildings sustained minor damage.  A few trees were damaged as the tornado continued northward just west of Halfway.  The funnel dissipated before the storm crossed into Loudoun County.  Another thunderstorm dropped two tornadoes along the Interstate 95 and 395 corridor southwest of Washington D.C.  The first tornado touched down on Quantico Marine Corps Base just north of Garrisonville.  A funnel cloud was spotted near Garrisonville shortly before the twister touched down.  Trees were downed on the base along the path of the F0 tornado.  Personnel sited it as it passed a quarter mile west of the fire station.  The tornado continued north into Prince William County where it downed some trees in Prince William Forest Park area.  The tornado moved north into the Lake Montclair community where it took down a few trees, broke branches, and bent siding up on homes.  The weak tornado lifted shortly after.  Because the storm passed through several limited access areas, part of the tornado track was not able to be surveyed.  It is possible the tornado may not have been on the ground the entire time.The second tornado which remained on the ground for 15 miles passed through densely populated areas of Eastern Fairfax County, the western portion of the city of Alexandria, and Arlington County.  The F1 tornado touched down just west of Fort Belvoir near Newington Road in Fairfax County.  It skipped north-northeast through Kingstown and Franconia following Beulah Street (Route 613).  Minor damage was reported at the intersections of Windsor Avenue, Fleet Drive, and Walker Lane.  Several townhomes on Beulah Street received minor damage to roofing and siding.  Debris was also reported in the Franconia Commons development.  The tornado could be seen from the Franconia-Springfield metro station.

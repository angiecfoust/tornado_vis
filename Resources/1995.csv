The last damage occurred near Morley Hill in Sandisfield at 1924 EST.  Officially, the track extended from one mile southeast of north Egremont to one and one-half miles southwest of West Otis.  Three people were killed when the automobile they were in was lifted several hundred feet in the air and then dropped into a wooded hillside.  Two of the dead were male students around 20 years old and the other was their male teacher, who was approximately in his late 50s.  Twenty-four people were injured.  National Weather Service investigation classified this storm as a ""devastating"" tornado.  Property damage (according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency) included the following:  two homes were destroyed, eleven homes had major damage, nineteen homes had medium damage, thirty-four homes had minor damage; one rental unit had major damage, three had medium damage, and four had minor damage.  Many of the injuries were from flying glass.  One motorist was very lucky when the tremendous force of the wind drove a large wooden timber through the door and front seat of his van and he escaped with his life and a hip injury.  A nursing home lost its roof and buildings at the local fairgrounds were destroyed.  A gas station was destroyed.  A truck smashed into a supermarket causing a large hole in the building.  Many roads were blocked for more than 24 hours by numerous fallen trees.  Total damage was estimated at between $20 and $25 million, with many losses covered by insurance.  Debris was carried more than 45 miles to the northeast to Belchertown in eastern Hampshire County, where a racing ticket from the fairgrounds was found along with white, corrugated plastic roofing material.  Other debris was found in Huntington and Montgomery in western Hampden County, about 25 miles away.  The last deaths caused by a tornado in Massachusetts occurred in 1979. (M20V, M20V, M58V)",CSV

Near the core of the damage path, hail was six inches deep with drifts to two feet.  An additional $8,000,000 in damage was sustained by Goodfellow Air Force Base. The storm that inflicted the destruction was a right-turning supercell that initially formed in Upton County, 75 miles west of San Angelo.  By the time it reached San Angelo, it was moving southeast.  The tremendous damage lead many to believe that a tornado had struck.  However, a survey team determined that the damage was mainly due to large hail and high winds.",CSV

The storm brought with it a significant cold pool with 500 mb temperatures falling to around -15° C during the late afternoon hours of the 27th.  The surface low pressure area moved across north-central Kansas into northeast Nebraska.  Aloft, the dry slot punched into western Iowa.  This set the stage for a major tornado outbreak as the jet stream dynamics were also very strong.  During the afternoon, temperatures warmed into the 70s F. with dew point temperatures in the middle to upper 60s F.  This combination produced a CAPE by the late afternoon hours in the 2500 J-kg-1.  The lifted indices were in the -7° to -9° C range with helicity values approaching 600 m2-s-2.  Strong thunderstorms fired over eastern Nebraska along the surface dry line.  The storms quickly became tornadic as the moved into Iowa.  There were several major tornadoes in Iowa.  One tornado of F4 strength moved from near Carroll to near Fonda.  This tornado caused extensive damage.  Many farmsteads were damaged along its path, some of which were totally wiped out.  The tornado was between one-fourth and one-half mile wide during part of its path.  Reports also indicate that the tornado took on a multiple vortex structure as it passed north of Mt. Carmel.  Another tornado of lesser strength moved from near Glidden towards Lanesboro.  There was some house damage with this tornado.  It was about 200 meters wide.  Carroll County was also clipped by another F4 strength tornado.  This tornado moved from near Coon Rapids to near Churdan.  It was at least 200 meters wide during much of its path.  At one point between Bayard and Scranton it was three-fourths of a mile wide.  The tornado picked up a car and tossed it more than one-fourth mile out into a field.  Debris from houses could be found one-half mile from their origin.  In addition, one girls homework papers were found some 55 miles away in the town of Gilmore City.  A receipt was also found in Gilmore City from the Bates residence, 75 miles to the south.  There was one injury from this tornado.  This tornado alone caused $2 million in damage.  Another tornado, and the one with the longest track, touched down near Creston and tracked north to near Perry.  This tornado had an interesting feature.  Aside from the fact that it was one-half mile wide at times, the tornado took on a double vortex structure around 2050 CST and continued this way for some time.  The double structure lasted at least 20 minutes and was captured on film as it crossed Interstate 80 between the 94 and 95 mile marker at 2058 CST.  Aerial photography revealed a definite split in the tornado track over Adair County.  The Iowa State Patrol closed off a four mile section of the Interstate to allow the half mile wide tornado to pass.  The track of this, as well as several other of the stronger tornadoes, was clearly visible from the air as striations in the soil of many fields.  Many farmsteads were also damaged or completely leveled by this tornado.  It resulted in at least one injury as a woman fled to her basement as the tornado approached.  The tornado hit her house, completely destroying it.  As the house collapsed she was struck with a fuel oil tank.  The tank broke her hip.  She was taken to a hospital in Greenfield, treated and released the next day.  The other two members of the family reported struggling to remain in the basement as the suction of the tornado nearly pulled them out.  There were also other minor injuries reported around the Greenfield area.  Another woman was injured in Stuart as she was thrown by the tornado while attempting to flee.  There was also one injury in Carroll County.  As the tornado moved through, there was one farmstead that lost five of the six buildings on it.  Two cars were destroyed almost beyond recognition.  A strong tornado set down in Decatur County near Lamoni.  This tornado moved into south-central Clarke County before dissipation.  Damage from it was relatively minor as it traversed open country as it paralleled Interstate 35 for some time.  The other tornadoes in the state were fairly small and did not cause catastrophic damage.  Some preliminary damage estimates from the harder hit counties include: $2 million in Greene County, $1.2 million in Carroll County,  $1,146,000 in Union County, $828,000 in Adair County, $642,000 in Sac County, and $160,000 in Guthrie County.  Six counties were declared disaster areas.  They were Greene, Adair, Carroll, Guthrie, Sac, and Union.  A quick run down of damages indicated a total of 52 homes were damaged, 13 of which were destroyed with 16 receiving heavy damage, and 10 businesses damaged or destroyed in the six named counties.  A total of 41 farmsteads reported damage caused by the tornadoes.  Several of the farm buildings were completely wiped off the map.  A break down by county showed seven homes and three businesses damaged in Sac County, 18 homes and two businesses damaged or destroyed in Carroll County, eight homes and two business damaged or destroyed in Greene County, two homes and two businesses damaged or destroyed in Guthrie County, seven homes and one business damaged or destroyed in Adair County, and ten homes damaged or destroyed in Union County.  Home and business damage alone in these counties amounted to between $4 and $5 million.  Iowa was very fortunate the tornadoes did not move directly into any large population areas.  In spite of the significant advance warning provided for these tornadoes, there would almost certainly have been significant loss of life has a major population area taken a direct hit.  The closest call was when the tornado headed for a state park in southern Iowa.  There was enough advance warning that officials evacuated the park before the tornado hit.  The park was hit and this could have been a disaster since it was a holiday weekend and all.  There was a significant loss of livestock along the tornadoes paths.  Numerous accounts were received of either dead or seriously injured livestock.  At the time of this writing there was on official tally of livestock loss.  As amazing as it may seem, there was not a great deal of severe weather associated with the storms.  One news report indicated that the title papers from a persons car in Creston was found in tact over 50 miles away in the town of Adel.  The freezing level was relatively low, 10,500 msl, yet there were only scattered reports of large hail.  Golf ball-size hail pelted the southeast side of Leon as well as the Greenfield area.  Hail of an inch diameter was also reported in the Ellsworth area.  Most of the hail was pea- to marble-size, and even at that, there were few reports.  Winds also were not a major problem.  There were some reports, such as the 60 mph wind gust at Churdan in Greene County.  The most significant wind occurred near Cromwell in Union County.  Eighty to 90 mph winds caused structural damage to several buildings there.  The storms produced some locally heavy rainfall in the state.  The scattered nature of the storms helped to reduce the amount of flash flooding.  Guthrie County did have some problems with the water as two and one-half inches of rain fell in Guthrie Center in two hours.  Flooding was reported in the Lake Panora area as well.  Storm total rainfall approached two inches in parts of the county.  The flooding was relatively minor and generally just ditches overtopping roads in spots.",CSV

The tornado path varied from very narrow at the beginning and end to about three-quarters of a mile wide at the widest location in Madison County.  Intensity varied from F0 intensity near both ends of the track to F4 at the strongest in several locations in Madison County.  Damage along the track was primarily in the F2 and F3 category.  Evidence in the damage as seen through an aerial survey indicated that the tornado was probably a multiple vortex with indications of at least two vortices within the main tornado funnel. The tornado began at 1633 CST in Limestone County crossing Interstate 65 and Highway 251 where the mobile home park was destroyed.  It reached the Limestone/Madison county line at 1650 CST.  The trek across Madison County saw the tornado move near the communities of Harvest, Meridianville, Buckhorn, and Fannings Crossing before moving into the rugged terrain of eastern Madison County.  The tornado crossed the Madison/Jackson county line at 1721 CST.  The tornado track was much weaker in Jackson County as it moved through rugged terrain affecting very few structures.  The track ended about 15 miles northwest of Scottsboro or a few miles west of the community of Hytop. Damage was the heaviest at a mobile home park about three miles northeast of Athens along Highway 251.  The only fatality that occurred in this tornado occurred at this mobile home park, and the person died later from injuries received in the tornado.  Twenty-six mobile homes were destroyed in Limestone County, 13 in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park.  Another 35 buildings were damaged or destroyed in Limestone County where damage was estimated to be $1.5 million.  About 9,500 electric customers were without electricity.  A cow was also killed when a large tree fell on and crushed it. Another especially hard hit area was Anderson Hills subdivision in Madison County with houses ranging in price from $175,000 to $400,000.  This area of well-constructed dwellings was one of the locations where F4 damage was evident as well as indications of a multiple vortex structure.  In Anderson Hills, 21 houses were destroyed and 39 sustained major damage.  Damage across the rest of Madison County was less concentrated than in this one subdivision.  Over 10,000 Huntsville Utility Company customers were without power. M30M",CSV

The first tornado touched down south of Bates City at 1820 CST and was crossing Interstate 70 3 miles west of Odessa at 1831 CST.  Only minor tree damage was reported.  It then lifted north of Odessa.  A second touchdown occurred about 5 miles northwest of Higginsville at 1845 CST.  The track took it across State Route 13 5 miles northwest of Higginsville near the Tabo Creek bridge at 1900 CST.  At 1905 CST, the tornado crossed Route 213 3 miles southwest of Dover, and then lifted 1 mile southwest of Dover at 1906 CST.  A house along state Route 13, 6 miles southeast of the junction with Route E, had shingles removed from the roof as the funnel apparently lifted as it passed overhead.  Eyewitnesses reported that the tornado bounced up and down as it continued on a path about 4.5 miles to the east-northeast.  The damage path varied from about 30 to 40 yards wide, with most of the path over cultivated farm fields.  Most damage was minimal, but the most significant damage occurred at the Humfeldt farm 2.6 miles south of U.S. Route 24 along state Route 213.  A corrugated steel equipment building was destroyed when the south and west walls were blown in, and the roof was partially peeled off.  There was only minor damage to the equipment inside.  The tornado passed to the south of the house and garage, missing them by 25 feet.  Only one shutter was blown off of the upper floor of the house with no other damage.  Mud was splattered on all four sides of both the house and garage.  The tornado was photographed as it was dissipating, in its rope stage between 1901 and 1906 CST.   In addition, tree damage occurred in Corder with the gust front ahead of the parent thunderstorm.",CSV

The air mass was very unstable with total total indices of 61, K indices over 30, and helicity values over 600 m2-s-2.  Soundings at 1200 UTC already indicated lifted indices of -7° C.  Moisture pooling was taking place ahead of a windshift line which extended north to south across central Nebraska at sunrise.  Dew point values rose to around 80° F. over most of Iowa in the morning.  A strong cap was in place with 700 mb temps nearing +15° C.  This held convection to a minimum.  Thunderstorms had formed the previous night across South Dakota and advanced into southern Minnesota.  They slid southeast and moved into north central Iowa during the late morning hours.  Golf ball-size hail pelted Worth County northeast of Northwood.  A short time later a second cell dropped dime-size hail on the area.  The storms advanced southeast producing hail and gusty winds.  Most of the activity was just below severe limits.  When the storms reached Clayton County, dime size hail was reported in Luana.  Meanwhile, in Garnavillo high winds were a problem.  Several trees and numerous power lines were downed in the city as the gust front passed.  In addition to the first cluster of storms that slid southeast, a line of thunderstorms formed quickly on its heels ahead of the trough/windshift line.  These storms quickly became severe in the unstable air mass and joined with the aforementioned cluster of storms.  Once the storms became severe, they produced considerable damage.  Hail up to baseball-size, very high winds, and tornadoes resulted.  There were several small tornadoes and one gustnado produced by the line.  Of the more significant tornadoes, one tracked across Buchanan and Delaware Counties and caused damage to many out buildings.  The tornado struck a few farmsteads directly and damaged many others.  Considerable damage was reported along its path.  One house was destroyed, two others sustained about $25 thousand damage each, five others sustained about $20 thousand damage, and a mobile home was destroyed worth $10 thousand.  A grain elevator was struck near Lamont with damage placed to it at $500 thousand.  A total of 19 farmsteads sustained damage in the county.  Crop damage by the tornado was also severe with damage described as if ""someone went through the fields with a Weedeater"".  Two head of cattle were killed near Lamont when the barn they were in collapsed.  Another tornado that was on the ground for a significant length of time tracked across Clinton County.  Other significant tornadoes struck Scott and Muscatine Counties.  Straight line winds caused considerable damage in Delaware County.  There were numerous reports of livestock killed or injured by fallen barns.  Three hogs were crushed on a farm near Hopkinton for example.  Damage from straight line winds alone in the county were placed near two and one half million dollars.  Damage was very extensive around the Hopkinton area with many farmsteads affected and some nearly wiped out.  Estimates from the entire Quad Cities metro area range to around $5 million.  There was also considerable damage in Jones County from high winds.  Wind gusts of at least 85 MPH destroyed 24 mobile homes and three permanent homes in Monticello.  There was also damage reported to several other houses and businesses in the area.  Other wind damage in the Monticello area included three silos destroyed, two large barns downed, two machine sheds, a corn crib, and six open sheds.  Three head of cattle were killed as one of the barns collapsed on them.  In another incident, a horse stable was blown down by the winds.  One horse was killed as the stable toppled down on it.  Also, in Monticello, a man was injured as high winds downed a tree on top of his car.  Reports indicated the total property damage in the Monticello area were at least $1.8 million and were expected to top the $2 million mark.  Estimates of crop damage due to the wind totaled close to $1 million across Jones County.  Cedar County, winds of 90 to 95 MPH in close proximity to a tornado in the area destroyed one house and several buildings north of Atalissa.  The tornado itself hit one farmstead north of the Atalissa area.  Reports indicated food was sucked out of the refrigerator and boards were taken out of loaded grain wagons.  When the house was hit, a letter from the attic was picked up shortly before 1900CST.  The letter was retrieved at 1940CST; 40 miles from its original location in the Quad Cities.  There were numerous reports of small rope tornadoes around the Lowden area.  Two are included in this report.  The tornado northwest of town touched down briefly in an open field.  There were actually three separate touchdowns from one parent cloud within a period of several minutes.  A local network of spotters in the county observed 24 funnel clouds.  In addition to the tornadoes and winds, hail was a major problem.  There were numerous reports of one to two-inch diameter hail.  There were also several reports of baseball-size hail. In Clinton County, Grand Mound and DeWitt were pelted with baseball-size hail causing considerable damage.  The airport at Clinton sustained damage by baseball-size hail as well.  In Calamus, baseball-size hail fell on the city.  The hail in combination with the wind damaged cars, knocking out windows.  Windows were also knocked out of several buildings in the city.  Hail also caused considerable crop damage in east central Iowa.  Five thousand acres of corn and soybeans were totally destroyed, 10,000 acres slightly damaged, 50 hogs killed, and 10 head of cattle killed in a three county area.  The Governor declared Buchanan, Delaware, and Jones Counties disaster areas.  Damage and losses totaled into the millions.  Earlier in the afternoon, lightning struck a barn in Winneshiek County  near Castalia.  The barn was a total loss as it burned to the ground.",CSV

At this time the tornado was approaching the small community of Raritan.  The Wendell Shaner farm site, located one and one-half miles southwest of Raritan, was hit at this time.  Mr. Shaner was thrown about 70 yards out of his home into a field east of the house.  Mr. Shaner received broken rips and other internal injuries.  The Shaner farm site was totally destroyed.  Where the home had been located there was nothing left, but the basement stuffed full of debris.  Hundreds of dead hogs were scattered along and up a hill to the northeast of the home site.  The tornado then clipped the southeast corner of the community of Raritan where damage was limited to areas along and south of main street.  The Carl Huss home was totally destroyed while he was in the basement.  Mr. Huss received a large bruise on his back when cement blocks were pulled in from the west side of the basement as the home was shredded off its foundation.  The 137-year-old farmstead of John and Bev Livermore was also hit at about this time.  Mr. Livermore was in the basement with his two grand-children when the tornado struck.  The home heating fuel tank, located in the basement, was sucked up and thrown 50 yards away from the house.  Mr. Livermore literally had to lay on his grandson to keep him from being pulled out of the basement.  The home was totally destroyed.  The Richard Likes home, also on the east side of Raritan, was totally blown off the foundation and pushed 50 yards into the field to the east.  The Likes were not home at the time.  This is also about the time the tornado appeared to reach its maximum width of 0.6 miles.  One to two miles northeast of Rariton the large tornado either weakened or dissipated.  Regardless, F0 to F1 damage and debris continued across Warren County from either the weakened tornado or multiple spinoff tornados.  The tornado finally exited Warren county about six miles southwest of Abingdon.  This large tornado produced no fatalities and only one injury was of a serious nature.",CSV

The track was through sparsely populated farm country, so damage figures were relatively low for such a long track tornado.  At each of five farmsteads in the direct path of the tornado, farm buildings were destroyed.  Destroyed farm buildings included hen houses, hog sheds, several barns, and storage sheds.  The worst damage, apparently of F2 intensity, occurred at a farm one mile south of Fredonia.  About $250,000 damage occurred at this farmstead alone, where a 70 foot tall concrete silo was sheared in two. Elsewhere along the track, barns were flattened, a garage was turned sideways, and a roof was lifted off a house.  Scraps of building debris were blown over a mile.  A storage building at an appliance store was moved 20 to 30 feet, exposing new appliances for sale.  At one residence, a child was moved off its bed moments before a 2x4 blew through the window into the child's bedroom.  Damage to outdoor objects and equipment was extensive. A 1,000 gallon tank was blown away, and grain bins were moved. Fences and satellite dishes were destroyed. Damage to expensive farm equipment, such as combines and hay balers, was moderate. Along wooded sections of the damage path, every tree was snapped or uprooted. Utility poles were snapped or blown over.",CSV

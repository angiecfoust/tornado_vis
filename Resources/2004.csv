Matthew made landfall as minimal tropical storm along the south central Louisiana coast near Cocodrie on October 10 and weakened to a tropical depression shortly after moving inland. Matthew continued north and moved across southeast Louisiana and southwest Mississippi as a tropical depression on the 10th before dissipating over extreme southeast Arkansas on October 11.Tropical storm force winds associated with Matthew were mainly confined to the coastal areas of Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, and Plaquemines Parishes and around Lake Pontchartrain in the form of gusts. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 42 knots (48 mph) with gusts to 48 knots (55 mph). The weather instruments at this location are located approximately 100 ft above sea level. The lowest pressure recorded was 999.7 mb at Tambour Bay on October 10th 0400 CST.Most of the damage associated from Matthew was the result of a combination of heavy rain and coastal flooding. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 5 to 10 inches with a few locations in Terrebonne, Lafourche and St. John the Baptist Parishes reporting amounts up to 13 to 16 inches. The storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal, but locally higher in some locations. The highest storm surge recorded was at Frenier on Lake Pontchartrain with a reading of 5.85 ft NGVD.  The greatest damage occurred in Terrebonne Parish where at estimated 20 homes sustained damage from heavy rain and storm surge in an area from Chauvin to Dulac, Montegut, and Pointe Aux Chene. In Lafourche several homes were flooded outside the flood gates from storm surge while within the flood gates several homes in Golden Meadow, Galliano, and Cutoff were flooded due to heavy rain. Law enforcement reported a brief tornado touchdown near Golden Meadow at 0349 CST on October 10th that tore half of the roof off of a trailer. Coastal flooding was observed around the shores of Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas and in most coastal areas outside of hurricane protection levees. Many roads were closed due to storm tide flooding in Lower Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Bernard, and extreme eastern Orleans Parishes.  Several roads in Slidell and Mandeville in St. Tammany Parish and around Laplace in St. John the Baptist Parish were also flooded.Based on observed damage, damages described by media and emergency management, and using a comparison of similar tropical storm events, total storm damage was estimated around 255 thousand dollars with approximately $50 thousand in damage from wind, $100 thousand in damage from storm surge, $100 thousand in damage from flooding as a result of heavy rain, and $5 thousand in damage from a brief tornado touchdown.",,PDS

A complex weather situation was in place due to the convection from the previous night.  An outflow boundary extended east to west across northern Missouri.  The synoptic frontal boundary extended from central Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The air was clear over Iowa during the day, allowing for temperatures to recover.  Dew point values also recovered quite rapidly with readings in the upper 60s to low 70s by the late afternoon hours.  Lifted indices dropped into the -5 to -10 C. range by evening with CAPE values approaching 5000 J/kg.  By the evening hours, the frontal boundary and outflow boundary had converged and were located along Interstate 80.  Explosive thunderstorm development took place during the very late afternoon and evening hours in spite of the weak shear profile.  Discrete supercells formed in a narrow line along Interstate 80 from near Des Moines on west.  The storms became tornadic quickly.  To add insult to injury, a strong thunderstorm complex formed over Nebraska and moved east along the line of convection over Iowa.  As the event took shape, all modes of severe weather occurred.  The storms developed so rapidly that there was little more than a half hour from the first hail and wind report to the first tornado touchdown.  Hail and high wind reports were too numerous to mention individually here.  Numerous reports of golf ball size hail were received.  Boone and Story Counties reported some of the largest hail with the event as baseball size hail pelted the are.  There was one report of very large hail northwest of Slater in Story County.  Hail five and one half inches in diameter punched 8 holes through a steel roof.  There was severe house siding and roof damage in the area.  There were numerous tornadoes, especially in the central Iowa Iowa.  At one point there were several supercells around the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Two of the stronger tornadoes touched down west and south of Des Moines.  Fortunately, most of the tornado tracks were over open areas and resulted in little damage.  High winds became a problem, especially after sunset, as the complex from Nebraska moved in.  The system became more of a derecho during the late night hours.  Eighty plus MPH winds pelted southwest Iowa and downed barns and several buildings in Adams and Cass Counties.  A beta bow element formed in central Iowa shortly before midnight.  The bow echo produced a measured wind gust of 106 MPH in northern Warren County.  The high winds continued to push east along Interstate 80 for the next hour or so before it started to weaken.  The other major problem was with heavy rain.  The convection from the previous night set the stage by saturating soils.  The echos trained for several hours across central Iowa with very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall rates of 4 to 5 inches per hour were common under the heavier cells.  Several locations received 2 to 5 inch rainfalls in under  two hours, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  Reports of major highways being inundated by water were common.  By the end of the night, a swath of 4 to 9 inch rainfall was evident north of Interstate 80.  Longer term river flooding became a major problem by the morning of the 23rd.  There were two lightning related injuries.  Two people were injured when they were struck by lightning out of doors in Nevada.

The deadliest and longest lived tornado started at 1644 CST, 0.7 miles North Northeast of Florid in Putnam County and moved northeast toward Granville.  The long lived nature of the tornado was due to it riding along a warm front pushing through Putnam and La Salle counties.  Satellite imagery indicated a strengthening mesocyclone at 1625 CST (2225 Z) with the formation of a new line of feeder clouds into the supercell, and KDVN 88D velocity data showed a strengthening TVS signature by 1635 CST (2235 Z).	Witnesses reported a multiple vortex tornado just prior to its arrival in Granville.  The tornado hit Granville at 1647-1648 CST which coincided with the failure of the main power feed into town.  The town was bisected by the half mile wide tornado with 12 buildings destroyed, 45 with major damage, and 26 with minor damage (mainly residential).  The Granville State National Bank lost its roof and Hopkins Elementary School lost the roof over the old gymnasium with damage in nearly all the classrooms.  Significant damage also occurred to Granville Drugs, the only drug store in town.  In a strange twist of irony, the town had finally recovered from a major fire 4 years earlier that decimated much of the business district.  The tornado continued northeast out of Granville and crossed over into La Salle County (WFO LOT) at 1653 CST (2253 Z), 3.8 miles Northeast of Granville.	The Granville/Utica tornado was the first significant test of a new statewide mutual aid response agreement.  In Granville 5 people were injured by the tornado, including an eldery female who suffered a heart attack during the tornado and was eventually Life Flighted to a Peoria hospital.

For the most part, the thunderstorms produced hail during this event.  There were numerous reports of hail of one to two inches in diameter.  Hail reportedly covered the ground in Guthrie County, into parts of Dallas County.  During the later evening hours, the thunderstorms began to sink south and took on a bow echo type configuration, though the line was not a true bow echo.  High winds began to be reported with Cass County being hit the worst.  A swath of damage 7 miles long was reported from west of Lewis to southeast of Lewis.  Embedded in the winds was a small tornado.  The tornado touched down intermittently along the 7 mile path and destroyed or damaged several grain bins and downed numerous trees.  A large corn crib was destroyed southeast of Atlantic and there were numerous reports of trees over highways.  In addition to the hail and high winds, heavy rain occurred from central into parts of west central Iowa.  Flash flooding occurred in Audubon, Guthrie, Madison, and Adair Counties.  Rain fell as the thunderstorms trained and redeveloped repeatedly over the same areas.  Rainfall rates were in the one to three inch per hour range with rainfall total reports of over 4 inches received in a few places in under two hours.

At the surface a warm frontal boundary extended nearly east to west across the state and provided the focus for thunderstorm development.  By the late afternoon, lifted indices were approaching -10 C. with CAPE values around 5000 J/kg over western Iowa.  Surface temperatures warmed into the upper 80s with dew points in the low to mid 70s.  A southwest surface wind of 15 to 25 kts pushed over the front.  Northeast of the frontal boundary winds were easterly around 10 to 15 kts.  Actually, the surface boundary was further enhanced by outflow from convective complexes during the day, further sharpening the contrast.  Thunderstorms continued to fire along and north of the boundary through the afternoon and into the evening.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding as very heavy rains fell on areas that had had significant rainfall the previous night.  There were reports in north central into northeast Iowa of 2 to 4 inches of rainfall in a little more than an hours time.  Major flooding took place in the Mason City area where evacuations were taking place.  The thunderstorms became most intense during the afternoon into the early evening.  There were several tornadoes across northeast into north central Iowa.  Most were relatively brief touchdowns and were in open areas.  Reports of multi-vortex tornadoes were received from Grundy County.  The days most significant tornado touched down in Pocahontas County east of Rolfe and tracked into Humboldt County through the Bradgate area.  The tornado damaged or destroyed over 75% of the town of Bradgate (pop 120).  Tornado damage in Bradgate was very extensive impacting most of the town.  Hardly a building was not impacted.   Outbuildings, light structures and garages were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Two homes were destroyed.  Several homes were damaged ranging from minor to extensive.  The Survey Team found that the majority of the damage was F1, with a few cases of F2 damage.  The F2 damage was to the snapping of very large trees just west of town and the structural damage to two buildings.  Nearly all of the 53 homes there reported damage with several totally destroyed.  Significant widespread property damage was reported in the tornadoes path.  There were several injuries in the town, the most significant being a broken leg.  A police officer was reportedly hit by debris from the tornado and suffered a broken leg.  According to law officials, the damage path of the tornado was 2 miles wide and about 8 miles long.  Storm chasers on the scene reported the tornado itself to be one half mile wide at one point.  Reports of hail were numerous through the afternoon and evening.  Most of the hail was in the three quarter inch to one inch diameter range.  There were a few reports of golf ball size hail from the stronger storms.  Winds were not a major problem with the activity.  There were spotty reports of winds to around 60 MPH, but most reports were in the 40 to 50 MPH range.  One of the stronger wind reports was a 64 MPH wind gust in Tripoli in Bremer County.  This gust was measured by a mesonet station there.  During the mid evening hours, thunderstorms rumbled across Grundy County.  Lightning struck the Sheriff's office there and destroyed a significant amount of office equipment.

Surface temperatures warmed into the upper 80s with dew points in the low to mid 70s.  A southwest surface wind of 15 to 25 kts pushed over the front.  Northeast of the frontal boundary winds were easterly around 10 to 15 kts.  Actually, the surface boundary was further enhanced by outflow from convective complexes during the day, further sharpening the contrast.  Thunderstorms continued to fire along and north of the boundary through the afternoon and into the evening.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding as very heavy rains fell on areas that had had significant rainfall the previous night.  There were reports in north central into northeast Iowa of 2 to 4 inches of rainfall in a little more than an hours time.  Major flooding took place in the Mason City area where evacuations were taking place.  The thunderstorms became most intense during the afternoon into the early evening.  There were several tornadoes across northeast into north central Iowa.  Most were relatively brief touchdowns and were in open areas.  Reports of multi-vortex tornadoes were received from Grundy County.  The days most significant tornado touched down in Pocahontas County east of Rolfe and tracked into Humboldt County through the Bradgate area.  The tornado damaged or destroyed over 75% of the town of Bradgate (pop 120).  Tornado damage in Bradgate was very extensive impacting most of the town.  Hardly a building was not impacted.   Outbuildings, light structures and garages were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Two homes were destroyed.  Several homes were damaged ranging from minor to extensive.  The Survey Team found that the majority of the damage was F1, with a few cases of F2 damage.  The F2 damage was to the snapping of very large trees just west of town and the structural damage to two buildings.  Nearly all of the 53 homes there reported damage with several totally destroyed.  Significant widespread property damage was reported in the tornadoes path.  There were several injuries in the town, the most significant being a broken leg.  A police officer was reportedly hit by debris from the tornado and suffered a broken leg.  According to law officials, the damage path of the tornado was 2 miles wide and about 8 miles long.  Storm chasers on the scene reported the tornado itself to be one half mile wide at one point.  Reports of hail were numerous through the afternoon and evening.  Most of the hail was in the three quarter inch to one inch diameter range.  There were a few reports of golf ball size hail from the stronger storms.  Winds were not a major problem with the activity.  There were spotty reports of winds to around 60 MPH, but most reports were in the 40 to 50 MPH range.  One of the stronger wind reports was a 64 MPH wind gust in Tripoli in Bremer County.  This gust was measured by a mesonet station there.  During the mid evening hours, thunderstorms rumbled across Grundy County.  Lightning struck the Sheriff's office there and destroyed a significant amount of office equipment.  Damage was reported around $100,000.",Tornado touched down in open fields northwest of Grundy Center.,PDS

A complex weather situation was in place due to the convection from the previous night.  An outflow boundary extended east to west across northern Missouri.  The synoptic frontal boundary extended from central Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The air was clear over Iowa during the day, allowing for temperatures to recover.  Dew point values also recovered quite rapidly with readings in the upper 60s to low 70s by the late afternoon hours.  Lifted indices dropped into the -5 to -10 C. range by evening with CAPE values approaching 5000 J/kg.  By the evening hours, the frontal boundary and outflow boundary had converged and were located along Interstate 80.  Explosive thunderstorm development took place during the very late afternoon and evening hours in spite of the weak shear profile.  Discrete supercells formed in a narrow line along Interstate 80 from near Des Moines on west.  The storms became tornadic quickly.  To add insult to injury, a strong thunderstorm complex formed over Nebraska and moved east along the line of convection over Iowa.  As the event took shape, all modes of severe weather occurred.  The storms developed so rapidly that there was little more than a half hour from the first hail and wind report to the first tornado touchdown.  Hail and high wind reports were too numerous to mention individually here.  Numerous reports of golf ball size hail were received.  Boone and Story Counties reported some of the largest hail with the event as baseball size hail pelted the are.  There was one report of very large hail northwest of Slater in Story County.  Hail five and one half inches in diameter punched 8 holes through a steel roof.  There was severe house siding and roof damage in the area.  There were numerous tornadoes, especially in the central Iowa Iowa.  At one point there were several supercells around the metropolitan Des Moines area.

High winds became a problem, especially after sunset, as the complex from Nebraska moved in.  The system became more of a derecho during the late night hours.  Eighty plus MPH winds pelted southwest Iowa and downed barns and several buildings in Adams and Cass Counties.  A beta bow element formed in central Iowa shortly before midnight.  The bow echo produced a measured wind gust of 106 MPH in northern Warren County.  The high winds continued to push east along Interstate 80 for the next hour or so before it started to weaken.  The other major problem was with heavy rain.  The convection from the previous night set the stage by saturating soils.  The echos trained for several hours across central Iowa with very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall rates of 4 to 5 inches per hour were common under the heavier cells.  Several locations received 2 to 5 inch rainfalls in under  two hours, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  Reports of major highways being inundated by water were common.  By the end of the night, a swath of 4 to 9 inch rainfall was evident north of Interstate 80.  Longer term river flooding became a major problem by the morning of the 23rd.  There were two lightning related injuries.  Two people were injured when they were struck by lightning out of doors in Nevada.

The frontal system that had moved through the state on the night of the 22nd was returning north as a warm front.  This time Iowa did not get completely into the warm sector.  The surface front was dragged north into Iowa by low pressure that moved out of Kansas northeast into central Iowa by the mid to late evening.  The airmass was pushed southeast out of the state by a cold front that passed through the state during the evening and early morning hours.  The airmass in the warm sector became very unstable.  Lifted indices were around -13 C with CAPE values greater than 5000 J/kg by the late afternoon.  The air advected north into Iowa during the day and into the evening.  Thunderstorms erupted in two places.  The first to affect the DSM CWA was the development of several elevated supercells over west central into southwest Iowa.  The storms continued to lift east and northeast across the area.  A few tornadoes touched down, however with the very elevated nature of the storms it was very difficult for the tornadoes to reach the ground.  By the late afternoon, a solid squall line developed along the cold front.  The line took on a Line Echo Wave Pattern by evening.  Several segments of the line bowed out, resulting in high winds.

Thunderstorms continued to fire along and north of the boundary through the afternoon and into the evening.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding as very heavy rains fell on areas that had had significant rainfall the previous night.  There were reports in north central into northeast Iowa of 2 to 4 inches of rainfall in a little more than an hours time.  Major flooding took place in the Mason City area where evacuations were taking place.  The thunderstorms became most intense during the afternoon into the early evening.  There were several tornadoes across northeast into north central Iowa.  Most were relatively brief touchdowns and were in open areas.  Reports of multi-vortex tornadoes were received from Grundy County.  The days most significant tornado touched down in Pocahontas County east of Rolfe and tracked into Humboldt County through the Bradgate area.  The tornado damaged or destroyed over 75% of the town of Bradgate (pop 120).  Tornado damage in Bradgate was very extensive impacting most of the town.  Hardly a building was not impacted.   Outbuildings, light structures and garages were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Two homes were destroyed.  Several homes were damaged ranging from minor to extensive.  The Survey Team found that the majority of the damage was F1, with a few cases of F2 damage.  The F2 damage was to the snapping of very large trees just west of town and the structural damage to two buildings.  Nearly all of the 53 homes there reported damage with several totally destroyed.  Significant widespread property damage was reported in the tornadoes path.  There were several injuries in the town, the most significant being a broken leg.  A police officer was reportedly hit by debris from the tornado and suffered a broken leg.  According to law officials, the damage path of the tornado was 2 miles wide and about 8 miles long.  Storm chasers on the scene reported the tornado itself to be one half mile wide at one point.  Reports of hail were numerous through the afternoon and evening.  Most of the hail was in the three quarter inch to one inch diameter range.  There were a few reports of golf ball size hail from the stronger storms.  Winds were not a major problem with the activity.  There were spotty reports of winds to around 60 MPH, but most reports were in the 40 to 50 MPH range.  One of the stronger wind reports was a 64 MPH wind gust in Tripoli in Bremer County.  This gust was measured by a mesonet station there.  During the mid evening hours, thunderstorms rumbled across Grundy County.  Lightning struck the Sheriff's office there and destroyed a significant amount of office equipment.  Damage was reported around $100,000.",Tornado touched down in open fields.  Dust debris blown across highway 14 as it crossed.  The track was intermittent and the tornado was reported to be multiple vortex at times with two tornadoes on the ground at one point northeast of Grundy Center.,PDS

The frontal system that had moved through the state on the night of the 22nd was returning north as a warm front.  This time Iowa did not get completely into the warm sector.  The surface front was dragged north into Iowa by low pressure that moved out of Kansas northeast into central Iowa by the mid to late evening.  The airmass was pushed southeast out of the state by a cold front that passed through the state during the evening and early morning hours.  The airmass in the warm sector became very unstable.  Lifted indices were around -13 C with CAPE values greater than 5000 J/kg by the late afternoon.  The air advected north into Iowa during the day and into the evening.  Thunderstorms erupted in two places.  The first to affect the DSM CWA was the development of several elevated supercells over west central into southwest Iowa.  The storms continued to lift east and northeast across the area.  A few tornadoes touched down, however with the very elevated nature of the storms it was very difficult for the tornadoes to reach the ground.  By the late afternoon, a solid squall line developed along the cold front.  The line took on a Line Echo Wave Pattern by evening.  Several segments of the line bowed out, resulting in high winds.  At times the winds reached 80 MPH.  One of the thunderstorms produced high winds in the Early area of Sac County.  They overturned a semi-tractortrailer truck, causing $80,000 damage and causing minor injuries to the driver.  Tornadoes that formed along this line actually formed where the Rear Flank Downdraft cut through the line.  A clear meso was formed and the small tornadoes advanced around the meso and were in front of the thunderstorm line.  Touchdowns were all brief.  Hail was common with the stronger storm, with much of it in the one to one and three-quarter inch in diameter.  Given the antecedent soil conditions in Iowa, flash flooding became a major issue.  Numerous counties reported flash flooding as rainfall of one to 4 inches in spots resulted in flooded highways.  The thunderstorms formed into an MCC by the early evening hours.  As they moved out of the state, they delivered one more punch to the state.  High winds developed in the wake of the complex.  Several counties of north central, northeast, and central Iowa received high winds.  Damage occurred in several locations to both trees and out buildings.  Sustained winds across the area were in the 25 to 45 MPH range with some higher gusts.  Clarion reported a wind gust of 63 MPH for the highest wind gust reported.",Brief tornado touchdown in open fields south of Mt Ayr.,PDS

A complex weather situation was in place due to the convection from the previous night.  An outflow boundary extended east to west across northern Missouri.  The synoptic frontal boundary extended from central Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The air was clear over Iowa during the day, allowing for temperatures to recover.  Dew point values also recovered quite rapidly with readings in the upper 60s to low 70s by the late afternoon hours.  Lifted indices dropped into the -5 to -10 C. range by evening with CAPE values approaching 5000 J/kg.  By the evening hours, the frontal boundary and outflow boundary had converged and were located along Interstate 80.  Explosive thunderstorm development took place during the very late afternoon and evening hours in spite of the weak shear profile.  Discrete supercells formed in a narrow line along Interstate 80 from near Des Moines on west.  The storms became tornadic quickly.  To add insult to injury, a strong thunderstorm complex formed over Nebraska and moved east along the line of convection over Iowa.  As the event took shape, all modes of severe weather occurred.  The storms developed so rapidly that there was little more than a half hour from the first hail and wind report to the first tornado touchdown.  Hail and high wind reports were too numerous to mention individually here.  Numerous reports of golf ball size hail were received.  Boone and Story Counties reported some of the largest hail with the event as baseball size hail pelted the are.  There was one report of very large hail northwest of Slater in Story County.  Hail five and one half inches in diameter punched 8 holes through a steel roof.  There was severe house siding and roof damage in the area.  There were numerous tornadoes, especially in the central Iowa Iowa.  At one point there were several supercells around the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Two of the stronger tornadoes touched down west and south of Des Moines.  Fortunately, most of the tornado tracks were over open areas and resulted in little damage.  High winds became a problem, especially after sunset, as the complex from Nebraska moved in.  The system became more of a derecho during the late night hours.  Eighty plus MPH winds pelted southwest Iowa and downed barns and several buildings in Adams and Cass Counties.  A beta bow element formed in central Iowa shortly before midnight.  The bow echo produced a measured wind gust of 106 MPH in northern Warren County.  The high winds continued to push east along Interstate 80 for the next hour or so before it started to weaken.  The other major problem was with heavy rain.  The convection from the previous night set the stage by saturating soils.  The echos trained for several hours across central Iowa with very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall rates of 4 to 5 inches per hour were common under the heavier cells.  Several locations received 2 to 5 inch rainfalls in under  two hours, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  Reports of major highways being inundated by water were common.  By the end of the night, a swath of 4 to 9 inch rainfall was evident north of Interstate 80.  Longer term river flooding became a major problem by the morning of the 23rd.  There were two lightning related injuries.  Two people were injured when they were struck by lightning out of doors in Nevada.  The lightning struck close by as they were carrying groceries into their home.  The jolt caused them to fall, resulting in laceration to the head.",Bief tornado touchdown in fields northeast of Newton.,PDS

A complex weather situation was in place due to the convection from the previous night.  An outflow boundary extended east to west across northern Missouri.  The synoptic frontal boundary extended from central Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The air was clear over Iowa during the day, allowing for temperatures to recover.  Dew point values also recovered quite rapidly with readings in the upper 60s to low 70s by the late afternoon hours.  Lifted indices dropped into the -5 to -10 C. range by evening with CAPE values approaching 5000 J/kg.  By the evening hours, the frontal boundary and outflow boundary had converged and were located along Interstate 80.  Explosive thunderstorm development took place during the very late afternoon and evening hours in spite of the weak shear profile.  Discrete supercells formed in a narrow line along Interstate 80 from near Des Moines on west.  The storms became tornadic quickly.  To add insult to injury, a strong thunderstorm complex formed over Nebraska and moved east along the line of convection over Iowa.  As the event took shape, all modes of severe weather occurred.  The storms developed so rapidly that there was little more than a half hour from the first hail and wind report to the first tornado touchdown.  Hail and high wind reports were too numerous to mention individually here.  Numerous reports of golf ball size hail were received.  Boone and Story Counties reported some of the largest hail with the event as baseball size hail pelted the are.  There was one report of very large hail northwest of Slater in Story County.  Hail five and one half inches in diameter punched 8 holes through a steel roof.  There was severe house siding and roof damage in the area.  There were numerous tornadoes, especially in the central Iowa Iowa.  At one point there were several supercells around the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Two of the stronger tornadoes touched down west and south of Des Moines.  Fortunately, most of the tornado tracks were over open areas and resulted in little damage.  High winds became a problem, especially after sunset, as the complex from Nebraska moved in.  The system became more of a derecho during the late night hours.  Eighty plus MPH winds pelted southwest Iowa and downed barns and several buildings in Adams and Cass Counties.  A beta bow element formed in central Iowa shortly before midnight.  The bow echo produced a measured wind gust of 106 MPH in northern Warren County.  The high winds continued to push east along Interstate 80 for the next hour or so before it started to weaken.  The other major problem was with heavy rain.  The convection from the previous night set the stage by saturating soils.  The echos trained for several hours across central Iowa with very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall rates of 4 to 5 inches per hour were common under the heavier cells.  Several locations received 2 to 5 inch rainfalls in under  two hours, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  Reports of major highways being inundated by water were common.  By the end of the night, a swath of 4 to 9 inch rainfall was evident north of Interstate 80.  Longer term river flooding became a major problem by the morning of the 23rd.  There were two lightning related injuries.  Two people were injured when they were struck by lightning out of doors in Nevada.  The lightning struck close by as they were carrying groceries into their home.  The jolt caused them to fall, resulting in laceration to the head.",Brief touchdown in open fields.,PDS

The frontal system that had moved through the state on the night of the 22nd was returning north as a warm front.  This time Iowa did not get completely into the warm sector.  The surface front was dragged north into Iowa by low pressure that moved out of Kansas northeast into central Iowa by the mid to late evening.  The airmass was pushed southeast out of the state by a cold front that passed through the state during the evening and early morning hours.  The airmass in the warm sector became very unstable.  Lifted indices were around -13 C with CAPE values greater than 5000 J/kg by the late afternoon.  The air advected north into Iowa during the day and into the evening.  Thunderstorms erupted in two places.  The first to affect the DSM CWA was the development of several elevated supercells over west central into southwest Iowa.  The storms continued to lift east and northeast across the area.  A few tornadoes touched down, however with the very elevated nature of the storms it was very difficult for the tornadoes to reach the ground.  By the late afternoon, a solid squall line developed along the cold front.  The line took on a Line Echo Wave Pattern by evening.  Several segments of the line bowed out, resulting in high winds.  At times the winds reached 80 MPH.  One of the thunderstorms produced high winds in the Early area of Sac County.  They overturned a semi-tractortrailer truck, causing $80,000 damage and causing minor injuries to the driver.  Tornadoes that formed along this line actually formed where the Rear Flank Downdraft cut through the line.  A clear meso was formed and the small tornadoes advanced around the meso and were in front of the thunderstorm line.  Touchdowns were all brief.  Hail was common with the stronger storm, with much of it in the one to one and three-quarter inch in diameter.  Given the antecedent soil conditions in Iowa, flash flooding became a major issue.  Numerous counties reported flash flooding as rainfall of one to 4 inches in spots resulted in flooded highways.  The thunderstorms formed into an MCC by the early evening hours.  As they moved out of the state, they delivered one more punch to the state.  High winds developed in the wake of the complex.  Several counties of north central, northeast, and central Iowa received high winds.  Damage occurred in several locations to both trees and out buildings.  Sustained winds across the area were in the 25 to 45 MPH range with some higher gusts.  Clarion reported a wind gust of 63 MPH for the highest wind gust reported.",The tornado was a brief touchdown in open areas.

Hail and high wind reports were too numerous to mention individually here.  Numerous reports of golf ball size hail were received.

Eighty plus MPH winds pelted southwest Iowa and downed barns and several buildings in Adams and Cass Counties.  A beta bow element formed in central Iowa shortly before midnight.  The bow echo produced a measured wind gust of 106 MPH in northern Warren County.  The high winds continued to push east along Interstate 80 for the next hour or so before it started to weaken.  The other major problem was with heavy rain.  The convection from the previous night set the stage by saturating soils.  The echos trained for several hours across central Iowa with very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall rates of 4 to 5 inches per hour were common under the heavier cells.  Several locations received 2 to 5 inch rainfalls in under  two hours, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  Reports of major highways being inundated by water were common.  By the end of the night, a swath of 4 to 9 inch rainfall was evident north of Interstate 80.  Longer term river flooding became a major problem by the morning of the 23rd.  There were two lightning related injuries.  Two people were injured when they were struck by lightning out of doors in Nevada.  The lightning struck close by as they were carrying groceries into their home.  The jolt caused them to fall, resulting in laceration to the head.",Brief touchdown in open field.,PDS

This warm front began the day nearly stationary, taking 8 hours to move from Vincennes to Bloomington, then rocketing northward as the low pressure system quickly pushed off to the northeast late, dragging a cold front through the state during the overnight hours. All the necessary ingredients for a major severe weather outbreak were falling into place.  Morning upper-air observations showed very deep moisture and intense wind shear (wind change in speed and direction with respect to height) in the lower levels of the atmosphere.  Fairly clear skies during the course of the day contributed to moderately strong instability across much of Indiana.  Along and north of the warm front, winds backed to the east-southeast, further enhancing the wind shear.  This area of enhanced shear with the deep moisture and instability pooled along it would serve as the focus for the first two rounds of severe weather in the Indianapolis County Warning Area (CWA) on May 30th.The first wave of severe weather came in the early afternoon, as individual rotating thunderstorms, or supercells, formed just south of the warm front, crossing over the boundary soon after forming and moving into the area of enhanced shear.  These supercells began to show strong rotation soon after their formation, and produced several funnel reports and confirmed tornadoes near Spencer and Ellettsville.  Each of these tornadoes were rated F1 on the Fujita Scale of Tornado Intensity, a rating corresponding to the partial peeling of roofs and destruction of small outbuildings.Wave number two began in the late afternoon and continued into the early evening hours. Additional supercell development occurred further west along the warm front, in an area that had been receiving plenty of heating all day, maximizing instability in the very moist air mass. This wave of storms included a storm that produced tornadoes in Fountain and Tippecanoe counties, one of which was rated F2 near Dayton, just southeast of Lafayette, and a long-lived supercell that tracked along and just south of the I-70 corridor, producing tornadoes in Brazil, Little Point, Monrovia, just south of Plainfield, Camby, and Indianapolis.  Power flashes from the Camby tornado were visible from the front door of NWS Indianapolis.  The strongest of these tornadoes was the Indianapolis tornado, which briefly achieved F2 strength on the southeast side near Keystone Avenue between Raymond and Troy where there was significant damage to numerous homes, a nursing home and an elementary school. 26 nursing home inhabitants were treated at local hospitals for minor injuries, and the rest were relocated as the building was inhabitable. In addition to this tornado, the Monrovia tornado was rated F1.  All additional tornadoes from this particular supercell were rated F0, a rating corresponding to moderate tree damage and damage to outbuildings and signboards. There was also a lightning fatality in Veedersburg in Fountain County as a 24 year old male was struck while on a baseball field.The final wave of severe weather came in the late evening and early nighttime hours, and was mostly in the form of wind damage, although brief tornadoes did occur along the squall line that had formed near the Mississippi River and tracked eastward, accompanying the passage of the cold front, including tornadoes near Lake Monroe and Crothersville in south central Indiana, and Atlanta and Frankton in north central Indiana.  The tornado near Lake Monroe was rated F1, while all additional tornadoes were rated F0.To complicate the issue, the repeated rounds of heavy rain caused flooding problems across much of the area, with several flash flood warnings and urban/small stream flood advisories being issued during the evening and overnight hours.Fifteen total tornadoes touched down in central Indiana on May 30th, with damage estimates approaching $13,000,000 for central Indiana alone. In all, an additional eight tornadoes touched down in portions of Indiana that are served by neighboring NWS forecast offices, bringing the statewide total for the day to 23, four over the yearly average of 19.  This places the May 30th outbreak as the second largest outbreak in state history, behind the outbreak of 2 June 1990, and ahead of the ""Super Outbreak"" of 3-4 April 1974.  37 tornadoes touched down statewide in the 1990 outbreak, and 21 tornadoes touched down during the Super Outbreak, which was the largest outbreak of tornadoes in recorded history, with 148 tornadoes touching down across 13 states and southern Canada, killing 351 and injuring thousands.

This wave of storms included a storm that produced tornadoes in Fountain and Tippecanoe counties, one of which was rated F2 near Dayton, just southeast of Lafayette, and a long-lived supercell that tracked along and just south of the I-70 corridor, producing tornadoes in Brazil, Little Point, Monrovia, just south of Plainfield, Camby, and Indianapolis.  Power flashes from the Camby tornado were visible from the front door of NWS Indianapolis.  The strongest of these tornadoes was the Indianapolis tornado, which briefly achieved F2 strength on the southeast side near Keystone Avenue between Raymond and Troy where there was significant damage to numerous homes, a nursing home and an elementary school. 26 nursing home inhabitants were treated at local hospitals for minor injuries, and the rest were relocated as the building was inhabitable. In addition to this tornado, the Monrovia tornado was rated F1.  All additional tornadoes from this particular supercell were rated F0, a rating corresponding to moderate tree damage and damage to outbuildings and signboards. There was also a lightning fatality in Veedersburg in Fountain County as a 24 year old male was struck while on a baseball field.The final wave of severe weather came in the late evening and early nighttime hours, and was mostly in the form of wind damage, although brief tornadoes did occur along the squall line that had formed near the Mississippi River and tracked eastward, accompanying the passage of the cold front, including tornadoes near Lake Monroe and Crothersville in south central Indiana, and Atlanta and Frankton in north central Indiana.  The tornado near Lake Monroe was rated F1, while all additional tornadoes were rated F0.To complicate the issue, the repeated rounds of heavy rain caused flooding problems across much of the area, with several flash flood warnings and urban/small stream flood advisories being issued during the evening and overnight hours.Fifteen total tornadoes touched down in central Indiana on May 30th, with damage estimates approaching $13,000,000 for central Indiana alone. In all, an additional eight tornadoes touched down in portions of Indiana that are served by neighboring NWS forecast offices, bringing the statewide total for the day to 23, four over the yearly average of 19.  This places the May 30th outbreak as the second largest outbreak in state history, behind the outbreak of 2 June 1990, and ahead of the ""Super Outbreak"" of 3-4 April 1974.  37 tornadoes touched down statewide in the 1990 outbreak, and 21 tornadoes touched down during the Super Outbreak, which was the largest outbreak of tornadoes in recorded history, with 148 tornadoes touching down across 13 states and southern Canada, killing 351 and injuring thousands.  Nationwide, several more tornadoes were reported, along with nearly 200 reports of large hail and nearly 600 reports of wind damage.  Reports occurred all along the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, stretching from central Minnesota all the way to northeast Texas.",An F1 tornado caused significant damage to a cabin northeast of Ellettsville. Most of the path was along a wooded area with numerous trees felled.,PDS

This warm front began the day nearly stationary, taking 8 hours to move from Vincennes to Bloomington, then rocketing northward as the low pressure system quickly pushed off to the northeast late, dragging a cold front through the state during the overnight hours. All the necessary ingredients for a major severe weather outbreak were falling into place.  Morning upper-air observations showed very deep moisture and intense wind shear (wind change in speed and direction with respect to height) in the lower levels of the atmosphere.  Fairly clear skies during the course of the day contributed to moderately strong instability across much of Indiana.  Along and north of the warm front, winds backed to the east-southeast, further enhancing the wind shear.  This area of enhanced shear with the deep moisture and instability pooled along it would serve as the focus for the first two rounds of severe weather in the Indianapolis County Warning Area (CWA) on May 30th.The first wave of severe weather came in the early afternoon, as individual rotating thunderstorms, or supercells, formed just south of the warm front, crossing over the boundary soon after forming and moving into the area of enhanced shear.  These supercells began to show strong rotation soon after their formation, and produced several funnel reports and confirmed tornadoes near Spencer and Ellettsville.  Each of these tornadoes were rated F1 on the Fujita Scale of Tornado Intensity, a rating corresponding to the partial peeling of roofs and destruction of small outbuildings.Wave number two began in the late afternoon and continued into the early evening hours. Additional supercell development occurred further west along the warm front, in an area that had been receiving plenty of heating all day, maximizing instability in the very moist air mass. This wave of storms included a storm that produced tornadoes in Fountain and Tippecanoe counties, one of which was rated F2 near Dayton, just southeast of Lafayette, and a long-lived supercell that tracked along and just south of the I-70 corridor, producing tornadoes in Brazil, Little Point, Monrovia, just south of Plainfield, Camby, and Indianapolis.  Power flashes from the Camby tornado were visible from the front door of NWS Indianapolis.  The strongest of these tornadoes was the Indianapolis tornado, which briefly achieved F2 strength on the southeast side near Keystone Avenue between Raymond and Troy where there was significant damage to numerous homes, a nursing home and an elementary school. 26 nursing home inhabitants were treated at local hospitals for minor injuries, and the rest were relocated as the building was inhabitable. In addition to this tornado, the Monrovia tornado was rated F1.  All additional tornadoes from this particular supercell were rated F0, a rating corresponding to moderate tree damage and damage to outbuildings and signboards. There was also a lightning fatality in Veedersburg in Fountain County as a 24 year old male was struck while on a baseball field.The final wave of severe weather came in the late evening and early nighttime hours, and was mostly in the form of wind damage, although brief tornadoes did occur along the squall line that had formed near the Mississippi River and tracked eastward, accompanying the passage of the cold front, including tornadoes near Lake Monroe and Crothersville in south central Indiana, and Atlanta and Frankton in north central Indiana.  The tornado near Lake Monroe was rated F1, while all additional tornadoes were rated F0.To complicate the issue, the repeated rounds of heavy rain caused flooding problems across much of the area, with several flash flood warnings and urban/small stream flood advisories being issued during the evening and overnight hours.Fifteen total tornadoes touched down in central Indiana on May 30th, with damage estimates approaching $13,000,000 for central Indiana alone. In all, an additional eight tornadoes touched down in portions of Indiana that are served by neighboring NWS forecast offices, bringing the statewide total for the day to 23, four over the yearly average of 19.  This places the May 30th outbreak as the second largest outbreak in state history, behind the outbreak of 2 June 1990, and ahead of the ""Super Outbreak"" of 3-4 April 1974.  37 tornadoes touched down statewide in the 1990 outbreak, and 21 tornadoes touched down during the Super Outbreak, which was the largest outbreak of tornadoes in recorded history, with 148 tornadoes touching down across 13 states and southern Canada, killing 351 and injuring thousands.

These supercells began to show strong rotation soon after their formation, and produced several funnel reports and confirmed tornadoes near Spencer and Ellettsville.  Each of these tornadoes were rated F1 on the Fujita Scale of Tornado Intensity, a rating corresponding to the partial peeling of roofs and destruction of small outbuildings.Wave number two began in the late afternoon and continued into the early evening hours. Additional supercell development occurred further west along the warm front, in an area that had been receiving plenty of heating all day, maximizing instability in the very moist air mass. This wave of storms included a storm that produced tornadoes in Fountain and Tippecanoe counties, one of which was rated F2 near Dayton, just southeast of Lafayette, and a long-lived supercell that tracked along and just south of the I-70 corridor, producing tornadoes in Brazil, Little Point, Monrovia, just south of Plainfield, Camby, and Indianapolis.  Power flashes from the Camby tornado were visible from the front door of NWS Indianapolis.  The strongest of these tornadoes was the Indianapolis tornado, which briefly achieved F2 strength on the southeast side near Keystone Avenue between Raymond and Troy where there was significant damage to numerous homes, a nursing home and an elementary school. 26 nursing home inhabitants were treated at local hospitals for minor injuries, and the rest were relocated as the building was inhabitable. In addition to this tornado, the Monrovia tornado was rated F1.  All additional tornadoes from this particular supercell were rated F0, a rating corresponding to moderate tree damage and damage to outbuildings and signboards. There was also a lightning fatality in Veedersburg in Fountain County as a 24 year old male was struck while on a baseball field.The final wave of severe weather came in the late evening and early nighttime hours, and was mostly in the form of wind damage, although brief tornadoes did occur along the squall line that had formed near the Mississippi River and tracked eastward, accompanying the passage of the cold front, including tornadoes near Lake Monroe and Crothersville in south central Indiana, and Atlanta and Frankton in north central Indiana.  The tornado near Lake Monroe was rated F1, while all additional tornadoes were rated F0.To complicate the issue, the repeated rounds of heavy rain caused flooding problems across much of the area, with several flash flood warnings and urban/small stream flood advisories being issued during the evening and overnight hours.Fifteen total tornadoes touched down in central Indiana on May 30th, with damage estimates approaching $13,000,000 for central Indiana alone. In all, an additional eight tornadoes touched down in portions of Indiana that are served by neighboring NWS forecast offices, bringing the statewide total for the day to 23, four over the yearly average of 19.  This places the May 30th outbreak as the second largest outbreak in state history, behind the outbreak of 2 June 1990, and ahead of the ""Super Outbreak"" of 3-4 April 1974.  37 tornadoes touched down statewide in the 1990 outbreak, and 21 tornadoes touched down during the Super Outbreak, which was the largest outbreak of tornadoes in recorded history, with 148 tornadoes touching down across 13 states and southern Canada, killing 351 and injuring thousands.

This warm front began the day nearly stationary, taking 8 hours to move from Vincennes to Bloomington, then rocketing northward as the low pressure system quickly pushed off to the northeast late, dragging a cold front through the state during the overnight hours. All the necessary ingredients for a major severe weather outbreak were falling into place.  Morning upper-air observations showed very deep moisture and intense wind shear (wind change in speed and direction with respect to height) in the lower levels of the atmosphere.  Fairly clear skies during the course of the day contributed to moderately strong instability across much of Indiana.

These storms produced hail, strong winds and a few tornadoes.  The storms started out in Gosper county and moved northeast.  There were several reports of funnel clouds in eastern Gosper county.  As the storms continued into Dawson and Buffalo counties, storm chasers continued to report funnels and hail.  The first tornado set down in southeast Sherman county near Rockville and was observed for a few minutes.  The next twister was in southwest Howard county near Farwell.  Another tornado was reported by a sheriff's deputy near the junction of Nebraska highways 92 and 11.  These tornadoes were in open county and caused little in the way of damage.  The town of Elba in Howard county has pummeled by large hail for period of time.  Broken windows and trees stripped of leaves were common throughout the small community.  The most destructive tornado occurred near the village of Cushing.  The tornado set down on a farm west of town and damaged several outbuildings and threw irrigation pipe across a field.  The tornado then cut a path across the south end of town, again damaging several outbuildings and some minor damage to a home.  The tornado dissipated just southeast of town.

Extensive flooding crippled the southern half of Bee county, where radar estimated up to 10 to 12 inches of rainfall may have fallen.  Virtually all roads througout the southern half of the Bee county were impassible. Several residents were reported to have been rescued.

The storms were in the form of short lines or bows as they moved through Jefferson, Perry, and Jackson Counties, including Mount Vernon and Carbondale. A couple of tornadoes were spawned in those areas. As the storms moved east, they evolved into an intense squall line, producing widespread damaging gusts around 60 MPH with isolated higher gusts to 90 MPH. Numerous trees were blown down in nearly every county. Some of the trees fell on roads and power lines. In Wayne County, trees and utility poles were down in Sims, but the northwest part of the county from Orchardville to Johnsonville was hardest hit with utility damage. In Hamilton County, the whole city of Mcleansboro was without power after numerous trees fell. Several of the trees landed on houses, causing severe damage to at least one house. Trees fell on vehicles in Mount Carmel, where gusts were reported to 68 MPH. At least two occupied vehicles were struck by falling trees, one on Route 34 north of Harrisburg, and another north of Old Shawneetown. In both cases, the occupants were freed by rescue workers without being injured. In Harrisburg, trees fell on several houses and vehicles, and a radio tower used for fire dispatch operations was blown down. Two roofs were blown off of houses in Raleigh, just north of Harrisburg. A tree fell on a house in Thebes, near the Mississippi River in Alexander County. The most intense winds (estimated near 90 MPH) occurred in Massac County about 5 miles west of Round Knob, where a house lost portions of its roof and attic. At least 10 to 15 trees were reported down in Massac County. The storms produced very heavy rain that caused street flooding. The U.S. Highway 51 overpass on the north side of Cairo was blocked by high water.","From Washington County, the tornado entered western Jefferson County about 5 miles south of where Interstate 64 crosses the county line, then moved northeast across the interstate near the Woodlawn exit. A semi was blown off the interstate near the exit. The tornado passed just south of Dix, then lifted north of Texico, less than 2 miles from the Marion County line. Damage in this very rural area consisted of numerous trees down and destroyed sheds and barns. About two dozen houses sustained damage, mostly due to trees falling on them. Many trees were on power lines, and power poles were snapped. The damage path was not continuous. The tornado was rated F-1 for just a brief portion of its track, where maximum winds were estimated near 110 MPH.",PDS

This warm front began the day nearly stationary, taking 8 hours to move from Vincennes to Bloomington, then rocketing northward as the low pressure system quickly pushed off to the northeast late, dragging a cold front through the state during the overnight hours. All the necessary ingredients for a major severe weather outbreak were falling into place.  Morning upper-air observations showed very deep moisture and intense wind shear (wind change in speed and direction with respect to height) in the lower levels of the atmosphere.  Fairly clear skies during the course of the day contributed to moderately strong instability across much of Indiana.  Along and north of the warm front, winds backed to the east-southeast, further enhancing the wind shear.  This area of enhanced shear with the deep moisture and instability pooled along it would serve as the focus for the first two rounds of severe weather in the Indianapolis County Warning Area (CWA) on May 30th.The first wave of severe weather came in the early afternoon, as individual rotating thunderstorms, or supercells, formed just south of the warm front, crossing over the boundary soon after forming and moving into the area of enhanced shear.  These supercells began to show strong rotation soon after their formation, and produced several funnel reports and confirmed tornadoes near Spencer and Ellettsville.  Each of these tornadoes were rated F1 on the Fujita Scale of Tornado Intensity, a rating corresponding to the partial peeling of roofs and destruction of small outbuildings.Wave number two began in the late afternoon and continued into the early evening hours. Additional supercell development occurred further west along the warm front, in an area that had been receiving plenty of heating all day, maximizing instability in the very moist air mass. This wave of storms included a storm that produced tornadoes in Fountain and Tippecanoe counties, one of which was rated F2 near Dayton, just southeast of Lafayette, and a long-lived supercell that tracked along and just south of the I-70 corridor, producing tornadoes in Brazil, Little Point, Monrovia, just south of Plainfield, Camby, and Indianapolis.  Power flashes from the Camby tornado were visible from the front door of NWS Indianapolis.  The strongest of these tornadoes was the Indianapolis tornado, which briefly achieved F2 strength on the southeast side near Keystone Avenue between Raymond and Troy where there was significant damage to numerous homes, a nursing home and an elementary school. 26 nursing home inhabitants were treated at local hospitals for minor injuries, and the rest were relocated as the building was inhabitable. In addition to this tornado, the Monrovia tornado was rated F1.  All additional tornadoes from this particular supercell were rated F0, a rating corresponding to moderate tree damage and damage to outbuildings and signboards. There was also a lightning fatality in Veedersburg in Fountain County as a 24 year old male was struck while on a baseball field.The final wave of severe weather came in the late evening and early nighttime hours, and was mostly in the form of wind damage, although brief tornadoes did occur along the squall line that had formed near the Mississippi River and tracked eastward, accompanying the passage of the cold front, including tornadoes near Lake Monroe and Crothersville in south central Indiana, and Atlanta and Frankton in north central Indiana.  The tornado near Lake Monroe was rated F1, while all additional tornadoes were rated F0.To complicate the issue, the repeated rounds of heavy rain caused flooding problems across much of the area, with several flash flood warnings and urban/small stream flood advisories being issued during the evening and overnight hours.Fifteen total tornadoes touched down in central Indiana on May 30th, with damage estimates approaching $13,000,000 for central Indiana alone. In all, an additional eight tornadoes touched down in portions of Indiana that are served by neighboring NWS forecast offices, bringing the statewide total for the day to 23, four over the yearly average of 19.  This places the May 30th outbreak as the second largest outbreak in state history, behind the outbreak of 2 June 1990, and ahead of the ""Super Outbreak"" of 3-4 April 1974.  37 tornadoes touched down statewide in the 1990 outbreak, and 21 tornadoes touched down during the Super Outbreak, which was the largest outbreak of tornadoes in recorded history, with 148 tornadoes touching down across 13 states and southern Canada, killing 351 and injuring thousands.  Nationwide, several more tornadoes were reported, along with nearly 200 reports of large hail and nearly 600 reports of wind damage.

A nearly stationary frontal boundary extended nearly east to west across the state along U.S. Highway 20, or roughly from Fort Dodge to Waterloo.  Very unstable air was to the south of the front with dew point temperatures in the low to mid 70s common.  By early afternoon, CAPE values were near 5000 J/KG with lifted indices in the -10 to -12 C. range.  A dry line advanced east toward the state along with the passage of a short wave lifting northeast across the area.  Thunderstorms fired along the triple point by the early afternoon hours in northwest Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly and produced tornadoes as the sounding profile became very favorable.  In addition, significant mid level cooling took place as 700 mb temperatures fell several degrees during the day.   Most of the storms remained over the north third of the state with numerous reports of tornadoes.  The bulk of the tornadoes progressed southeast from northwest Iowa into the central counties of the state as the afternoon turned into evening.  For the most part, the tornadoes were quite small with only a few remaining on the ground for more than a few tenths of a mile.  Two tornadoes in Palo Alto and Emmet Counties were on the ground for a significant period of time, however they tracked over open country.  There were several tornadoes in Webster County.  Most of them were also small and did little damage, however one tornado near Otho hit two farmsteads there causing considerable damage.  One farmstead was nearly destroyed, including significant damage to the house.  Hail was common with the storms with much of it in the three quarter to one and one quarter inch diameter range.  There were a few golf ball size hail reports in Webster and Hamilton Counties, and one tennis ball size hail report in Stratford in Hamilton County.  Spotty reports of high were were received.  Winds were in the 60 to 70 MPH range.  Rainfall became a problem in a couple areas.  In Kossuth County rainfall of 2 to over 3 inches fell in under 2 hours causing flooding around the County.  Several roads became flooded, including Iowa Highway 9 and U.S. Highway 169.  Very heavy rain in the 2 to 4 inch range fell in Hamilton County during a 2 hour period.  This caused considerable flooding in the county, especially over the northwest half.  There was one high wind event.  In what turned out to be a high wind event occurred in Marion County.  A 60 MPH wind was recorded in Pella.  The event was in the wake of the line of thunderstorms and actually effected a several county area with winds of 40 to 50 MPH.  Temperatures shot up 9 degrees in a few minutes at the Des Moines Airport as a 51 MPH wind gust pushed the temperature up to 90 during the mid evening hours.",Rope like tornado touched down several times west of Moorland in open fields.,PDS

Severe weather development was focused in two areas of the region. Convective initiation occurred first near a sub-synoptic scale outflow boundary that was situated across the southeast Permian Basin. This feature was a remnant from overnight convection to the northeast of the area. Two supercell thunderstorms developed along the boundary over rural areas of southeast Midland and northern Upton Counties. As these storms moved east, storm-scale outflow boundaries were observed in local warning radar base reflectivity and velocity data arcing away from the storms toward the west. Both of these boundaries interacted with the larger scale baroclinic boundary under a field of strongly growing convective towers over southern and central Midland County and northeast Crane County. A series of at least four landspout tornadoes were observed as these interactions occurred.The mesoscale boundary began propagating west-northwest across the basin as the supercell storms provided convective enhancement to the cool (east) side of the boundary. Meanwhile strong to severe thunderstorms began propagating east from the mountainous areas of southeast New Mexico and southwest Texas. The convectively enhanced outflow boundary interacted with the complex of storms over the Upper Trans Pecos region. Large hail and two tornadoes were observed in east-central Reeves County.",The Odessa Police Department reported a tornado (landspout) in northeast Crane County near U.S. Highway 385.A series of at least four landspout tornadoes developed as outflow from two isolated severe thunderstorms interacted with a pre-existing boundary remnant from the previous night's convection.

Radar indications suggested that the strongest storms tracked over remote parts of southern Pecos County and northwest Terrell Counties, where several Tornado Warnings were issued based on Doppler radar signatures of intense mesocyclone circulations. Although one tornado was spotted by a sheriff's deputy dispatched to observe the storms, the most dangerous activity remained over open range land.Severe convective development began to spread north along a dryline during the late afternoon and evening hours.

At least two supercell storms produced giant hail and one strong tornado over the region.A supercell thunderstorm tracked across Terrell County in the west Texas Lower Trans Pecos region during the late afternoon hours. Multiple reports of large hail including two different instances of tennis ball sized stones were received as this storm tracked east along U.S. Highway 90 between Sanderson and Dryden.A second area of convection erupted over the eastern Permian Basin by late afternoon and continued into the evening hours. A severe storm associated with this activity produced half-dollar size hail in the Westbrook community. An isolated classic supercell evolved from this complex of storms and took on a distinctly deviant southeastward storm motion. This storm took on radar characteristics consistent with a classic tornadic supercell. Hail up to the size of golfballs was observed southeast of Colorado City as the storm evolved into its tornadic phase. A long-lived significant tornado tracked across mainly rural areas of Mitchell County just after sunset. The tornado resulted in three injuries when it crossed State Route 208 and blew a vehicle off of the highway. Severe rear flank downdraft winds also resulted in widespread wind damage south of the tornado's path.","A National Weather Service damage survey team concluded that a significant tornado struck rural areas of southeastern Mitchell County during the evening of the 11th. The team examined a damage path marked by shredded vegetation (mostly mesquite trees),  downed utility poles, agricultural fences, and a complex of destroyed mobile homes that extended over ten miles in a continuous horseshoe shaped path that crossed State Route 208 twenty miles south-southeast of Colorado City.The tornado developed seventeen miles south-southeast of Colorado City around 2028 CST. Damage indicates the tornado's motion was initially toward the southeast then east as it crossed the heavily traveled State Route 208. Two Texas Tech University students traveling north on 208 (south of the tornado's path) watched as a Ford Expedition drove into the tornadic circulation. The large sports utility vehicle was blown 100 yards off of the highway. Evidence supports the vehicle was rolled a considerable distance by the tornadic winds, but it is unclear whether it became airborne. Three motorists were transferred to local hospitals. One person sustained serious injuries that included a broken back.A detailed damage path analysis and corresponding radar data suggest that the tornado then tracked very slowly east a few miles before curving to the northeast. Similar curved damage paths (turning left of the tornado's original motion) are commonly observed when well-developed tornadoes enter the dissipation stage. The tornado proved to remain very dangerous, however, as eight mobile homes were destroyed by the tornado near the end of its life cycle twenty miles southeast of Colorado City. The light weight and unanchored structures were blown over and shredded by the dissipation stage tornadic winds. The trailers were arranged in a complex and were used to provide shelter for groups of hunters that frequent the ranch property. They were not occupied when the tornado struck.",PDS

A warm front moving north through the area resulted in favorable vertical wind shear to allow for supercell development.The 1st round of severe weather was due to a broken line of intense thunderstorms moving  across Walworth, Milwaukee, Racine and Kenosha counties.  Hail of up to 1 inch in diameter and torrential rainfall accompanied these storms before they moved over Lake Michigan and weakened.  The 2nd round of severe weather was dominated by 2 cyclic supercells - one moved east/southeast through Marquette, Green Lake, Fond du Lac, and Washington Counties, spinning up 5 separate tornadoes, dumping hail stones up to 3 inches in diameter, and hurricane-force downburst winds.  The large hail dented several vehicles.  Two of these were rated F3.  Refer to the individual tornado reports for more details.  A more southerly supercell tracked across extreme southern Sauk County and then made a partial right turn and headed southeast through Dane County, spinning up 2 tornadoes in the process, as well as large hail and downburst winds.  One powerful downburst wind in Madison (Dane Co.) blew equipment off the roof of a business at the Midvale Shopping Mall.  A semi southwest of Ft. Atkinson was blown over by straight-line wind gusts.  This southern supercell eventually spun up another tornado in south-central Jefferson County which moved into north-central Walworth County.  Refer to the individual tornado reports for more details.Both supercells had downbursts that generated large hail and powerful, hurricane-force winds north and south of their tracks.  Over all of Wisconsin, 16 tornadoes were documented on June 23rd, which is the 4th highest single-day total (record is 24 on May 8, 1988).  For south-central and southeast Wisconsin, the 8 tornadoes on June 23rd was tied for the 4th highest single-day total (record is 11 on May 8, 1988).","A weak F1 tornado (100-110 mph) spun up just west of the southwest Beltline at a point 2.5 miles SW of Middleton (half-mile north of intersection of CTH S and Pleasant View Rd.).  It moved east-southeast across the West Town Mall, through the UW-Madison Research Park, ultimately ending about 1/3 mile east of STH 151/Park St (2.3 miles south of Capitol Square).  In the Research Park many windows were blown out of business offices, and damage was inflicted to UW-MSN agricultural buildings.  At least 194 residential homes had minor damage (roof/siding), and 11 had major damage (windows/roofs - total of $410K).  At least 8 businesses had minor damage, and 1 had major damage (roof partially torn off and 1 wall damaged).  Total business damage was about $246K.  The UW-Madison Research Park had about $729K in damage.  Many vehicles sustained some degree of damage ($100K), and one semi was blown over.  At least 1000 large trees were damaged.  Estimated total tornado damage is $1.485M.  An additional cleanup cost of about $347K was reported. At least 2000 customers lost their electrical power.  Average path width was about 150 yards.",PDS

Later in the night, mostly in the early hours of May 31st, a potent cold front burst through, bringing destruction to most if not all eastern Kentucky counties.  Also, so much rain had fallen from the previous afternoon and evening, coupled with more heavy rain during the morning of May 31st, that widespread aerial flooding occurred.  For some counties, as was the case for Estill and Powell Counties, the aerial flooding lasted for days.  The cost of these storms totaled easily in the millions.","A tornado touched down near Erose along Highway 718.  The tornado was on the ground for 1, 338 feet.

This warm front began the day nearly stationary, taking 8 hours to move from Vincennes to Bloomington, then rocketing northward as the low pressure system quickly pushed off to the northeast late, dragging a cold front through the state during the overnight hours. All the necessary ingredients for a major severe weather outbreak were falling into place.  Morning upper-air observations showed very deep moisture and intense wind shear (wind change in speed and direction with respect to height) in the lower levels of the atmosphere.  Fairly clear skies during the course of the day contributed to moderately strong instability across much of Indiana.  Along and north of the warm front, winds backed to the east-southeast, further enhancing the wind shear.  This area of enhanced shear with the deep moisture and instability pooled along it would serve as the focus for the first two rounds of severe weather in the Indianapolis County Warning Area (CWA) on May 30th.The first wave of severe weather came in the early afternoon, as individual rotating thunderstorms, or supercells, formed just south of the warm front, crossing over the boundary soon after forming and moving into the area of enhanced shear.  These supercells began to show strong rotation soon after their formation, and produced several funnel reports and confirmed tornadoes near Spencer and Ellettsville.  Each of these tornadoes were rated F1 on the Fujita Scale of Tornado Intensity, a rating corresponding to the partial peeling of roofs and destruction of small outbuildings.Wave number two began in the late afternoon and continued into the early evening hours. Additional supercell development occurred further west along the warm front, in an area that had been receiving plenty of heating all day, maximizing instability in the very moist air mass. This wave of storms included a storm that produced tornadoes in Fountain and Tippecanoe counties, one of which was rated F2 near Dayton, just southeast of Lafayette, and a long-lived supercell that tracked along and just south of the I-70 corridor, producing tornadoes in Brazil, Little Point, Monrovia, just south of Plainfield, Camby, and Indianapolis.  Power flashes from the Camby tornado were visible from the front door of NWS Indianapolis.  The strongest of these tornadoes was the Indianapolis tornado, which briefly achieved F2 strength on the southeast side near Keystone Avenue between Raymond and Troy where there was significant damage to numerous homes, a nursing home and an elementary school. 26 nursing home inhabitants were treated at local hospitals for minor injuries, and the rest were relocated as the building was inhabitable. In addition to this tornado, the Monrovia tornado was rated F1.  All additional tornadoes from this particular supercell were rated F0, a rating corresponding to moderate tree damage and damage to outbuildings and signboards. There was also a lightning fatality in Veedersburg in Fountain County as a 24 year old male was struck while on a baseball field.The final wave of severe weather came in the late evening and early nighttime hours, and was mostly in the form of wind damage, although brief tornadoes did occur along the squall line that had formed near the Mississippi River and tracked eastward, accompanying the passage of the cold front, including tornadoes near Lake Monroe and Crothersville in south central Indiana, and Atlanta and Frankton in north central Indiana.  The tornado near Lake Monroe was rated F1, while all additional tornadoes were rated F0.To complicate the issue, the repeated rounds of heavy rain caused flooding problems across much of the area, with several flash flood warnings and urban/small stream flood advisories being issued during the evening and overnight hours.Fifteen total tornadoes touched down in central Indiana on May 30th, with damage estimates approaching $13,000,000 for central Indiana alone. In all, an additional eight tornadoes touched down in portions of Indiana that are served by neighboring NWS forecast offices, bringing the statewide total for the day to 23, four over the yearly average of 19.  This places the May 30th outbreak as the second largest outbreak in state history, behind the outbreak of 2 June 1990, and ahead of the ""Super Outbreak"" of 3-4 April 1974.  37 tornadoes touched down statewide in the 1990 outbreak, and 21 tornadoes touched down during the Super Outbreak, which was the largest outbreak of tornadoes in recorded history, with 148 tornadoes touching down across 13 states and southern Canada, killing 351 and injuring thousands.  Nationwide, several more tornadoes were reported, along with nearly 200 reports of large hail and nearly 600 reports of wind damage.  Reports occurred all along the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, stretching from central Minnesota all the way to northeast Texas.",A tornado touched down near Dayton. The tornado caused significant tree damage and blew parts of roofs off two buildings in Dayton. The tornado continued moving northeast with sporadic damage until reaching large homes approximately 1.5 miles northeast of Dayton.  Two homes were nearly destroyed on Halifax Lane.

Severe weather development was focused in two areas of the region. Convective initiation occurred first near a sub-synoptic scale outflow boundary that was situated across the southeast Permian Basin. This feature was a remnant from overnight convection to the northeast of the area. Two supercell thunderstorms developed along the boundary over rural areas of southeast Midland and northern Upton Counties. As these storms moved east, storm-scale outflow boundaries were observed in local warning radar base reflectivity and velocity data arcing away from the storms toward the west. Both of these boundaries interacted with the larger scale baroclinic boundary under a field of strongly growing convective towers over southern and central Midland County and northeast Crane County. A series of at least four landspout tornadoes were observed as these interactions occurred.The mesoscale boundary began propagating west-northwest across the basin as the supercell storms provided convective enhancement to the cool (east) side of the boundary. Meanwhile strong to severe thunderstorms began propagating east from the mountainous areas of southeast New Mexico and southwest Texas. The convectively enhanced outflow boundary interacted with the complex of storms over the Upper Trans Pecos region. Large hail and two tornadoes were observed in east-central Reeves County.",A third landspout tornado was observed southeast of the city. This tornado likely crossed State Route 158.,PDS

This warm front began the day nearly stationary, taking 8 hours to move from Vincennes to Bloomington, then rocketing northward as the low pressure system quickly pushed off to the northeast late, dragging a cold front through the state during the overnight hours. All the necessary ingredients for a major severe weather outbreak were falling into place.  Morning upper-air observations showed very deep moisture and intense wind shear (wind change in speed and direction with respect to height) in the lower levels of the atmosphere.  Fairly clear skies during the course of the day contributed to moderately strong instability across much of Indiana.  Along and north of the warm front, winds backed to the east-southeast, further enhancing the wind shear.  This area of enhanced shear with the deep moisture and instability pooled along it would serve as the focus for the first two rounds of severe weather in the Indianapolis County Warning Area (CWA) on May 30th.The first wave of severe weather came in the early afternoon, as individual rotating thunderstorms, or supercells, formed just south of the warm front, crossing over the boundary soon after forming and moving into the area of enhanced shear.  These supercells began to show strong rotation soon after their formation, and produced several funnel reports and confirmed tornadoes near Spencer and Ellettsville.  Each of these tornadoes were rated F1 on the Fujita Scale of Tornado Intensity, a rating corresponding to the partial peeling of roofs and destruction of small outbuildings.Wave number two began in the late afternoon and continued into the early evening hours. Additional supercell development occurred further west along the warm front, in an area that had been receiving plenty of heating all day, maximizing instability in the very moist air mass. This wave of storms included a storm that produced tornadoes in Fountain and Tippecanoe counties, one of which was rated F2 near Dayton, just southeast of Lafayette, and a long-lived supercell that tracked along and just south of the I-70 corridor, producing tornadoes in Brazil, Little Point, Monrovia, just south of Plainfield, Camby, and Indianapolis.  Power flashes from the Camby tornado were visible from the front door of NWS Indianapolis.  The strongest of these tornadoes was the Indianapolis tornado, which briefly achieved F2 strength on the southeast side near Keystone Avenue between Raymond and Troy where there was significant damage to numerous homes, a nursing home and an elementary school. 26 nursing home inhabitants were treated at local hospitals for minor injuries, and the rest were relocated as the building was inhabitable. In addition to this tornado, the Monrovia tornado was rated F1.  All additional tornadoes from this particular supercell were rated F0, a rating corresponding to moderate tree damage and damage to outbuildings and signboards. There was also a lightning fatality in Veedersburg in Fountain County as a 24 year old male was struck while on a baseball field.The final wave of severe weather came in the late evening and early nighttime hours, and was mostly in the form of wind damage, although brief tornadoes did occur along the squall line that had formed near the Mississippi River and tracked eastward, accompanying the passage of the cold front, including tornadoes near Lake Monroe and Crothersville in south central Indiana, and Atlanta and Frankton in north central Indiana.  The tornado near Lake Monroe was rated F1, while all additional tornadoes were rated F0.To complicate the issue, the repeated rounds of heavy rain caused flooding problems across much of the area, with several flash flood warnings and urban/small stream flood advisories being issued during the evening and overnight hours.Fifteen total tornadoes touched down in central Indiana on May 30th, with damage estimates approaching $13,000,000 for central Indiana alone. In all, an additional eight tornadoes touched down in portions of Indiana that are served by neighboring NWS forecast offices, bringing the statewide total for the day to 23, four over the yearly average of 19.  This places the May 30th outbreak as the second largest outbreak in state history, behind the outbreak of 2 June 1990, and ahead of the ""Super Outbreak"" of 3-4 April 1974.  37 tornadoes touched down statewide in the 1990 outbreak, and 21 tornadoes touched down during the Super Outbreak, which was the largest outbreak of tornadoes in recorded history, with 148 tornadoes touching down across 13 states and southern Canada, killing 351 and injuring thousands.  Nationwide, several more tornadoes were reported, along with nearly 200 reports of large hail and nearly 600 reports of wind damage.  Reports occurred all along the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, stretching from central Minnesota all the way to northeast Texas.","A tornado cut a near continuous 18 mile path across southern and eastern Marion County before briefly moving into Hancock County. The tornado dropped down near exit 4 at Harding Street and Interstate 465 on the south side of metro Indianapolis and moved into Hancock County to near Mount Comfort. The worst damage was found near South Keystone Avenue between Raymond St. And Troy. The damage was rated F2 there. There was significant damage to numerous homes, a nursing home and an elementary school. 26 nursing home inhabitants were treated at local hospitals for mainly minor cuts and scrapes, and the rest were relocated as the building was inhabitable. The tornado continued across 465 at Post Road and then lifted. Additional brief touchdowns (F0) occurred near 21st Street, 25th and Mittehoffer and German Church Road and 30th Street.

This warm front began the day nearly stationary, taking 8 hours to move from Vincennes to Bloomington, then rocketing northward as the low pressure system quickly pushed off to the northeast late, dragging a cold front through the state during the overnight hours. All the necessary ingredients for a major severe weather outbreak were falling into place.  Morning upper-air observations showed very deep moisture and intense wind shear (wind change in speed and direction with respect to height) in the lower levels of the atmosphere.  Fairly clear skies during the course of the day contributed to moderately strong instability across much of Indiana.  Along and north of the warm front, winds backed to the east-southeast, further enhancing the wind shear.  This area of enhanced shear with the deep moisture and instability pooled along it would serve as the focus for the first two rounds of severe weather in the Indianapolis County Warning Area (CWA) on May 30th.The first wave of severe weather came in the early afternoon, as individual rotating thunderstorms, or supercells, formed just south of the warm front, crossing over the boundary soon after forming and moving into the area of enhanced shear.  These supercells began to show strong rotation soon after their formation, and produced several funnel reports and confirmed tornadoes near Spencer and Ellettsville.  Each of these tornadoes were rated F1 on the Fujita Scale of Tornado Intensity, a rating corresponding to the partial peeling of roofs and destruction of small outbuildings.Wave number two began in the late afternoon and continued into the early evening hours. Additional supercell development occurred further west along the warm front, in an area that had been receiving plenty of heating all day, maximizing instability in the very moist air mass. This wave of storms included a storm that produced tornadoes in Fountain and Tippecanoe counties, one of which was rated F2 near Dayton, just southeast of Lafayette, and a long-lived supercell that tracked along and just south of the I-70 corridor, producing tornadoes in Brazil, Little Point, Monrovia, just south of Plainfield, Camby, and Indianapolis.  Power flashes from the Camby tornado were visible from the front door of NWS Indianapolis.  The strongest of these tornadoes was the Indianapolis tornado, which briefly achieved F2 strength on the southeast side near Keystone Avenue between Raymond and Troy where there was significant damage to numerous homes, a nursing home and an elementary school. 26 nursing home inhabitants were treated at local hospitals for minor injuries, and the rest were relocated as the building was inhabitable. In addition to this tornado, the Monrovia tornado was rated F1.  All additional tornadoes from this particular supercell were rated F0, a rating corresponding to moderate tree damage and damage to outbuildings and signboards. There was also a lightning fatality in Veedersburg in Fountain County as a 24 year old male was struck while on a baseball field.The final wave of severe weather came in the late evening and early nighttime hours, and was mostly in the form of wind damage, although brief tornadoes did occur along the squall line that had formed near the Mississippi River and tracked eastward, accompanying the passage of the cold front, including tornadoes near Lake Monroe and Crothersville in south central Indiana, and Atlanta and Frankton in north central Indiana.  The tornado near Lake Monroe was rated F1, while all additional tornadoes were rated F0.To complicate the issue, the repeated rounds of heavy rain caused flooding problems across much of the area, with several flash flood warnings and urban/small stream flood advisories being issued during the evening and overnight hours.Fifteen total tornadoes touched down in central Indiana on May 30th, with damage estimates approaching $13,000,000 for central Indiana alone. In all, an additional eight tornadoes touched down in portions of Indiana that are served by neighboring NWS forecast offices, bringing the statewide total for the day to 23, four over the yearly average of 19.  This places the May 30th outbreak as the second largest outbreak in state history, behind the outbreak of 2 June 1990, and ahead of the ""Super Outbreak"" of 3-4 April 1974.  37 tornadoes touched down statewide in the 1990 outbreak, and 21 tornadoes touched down during the Super Outbreak, which was the largest outbreak of tornadoes in recorded history, with 148 tornadoes touching down across 13 states and southern Canada, killing 351 and injuring thousands.

As the storms continued into Dawson and Buffalo counties, storm chasers continued to report funnels and hail.  The first tornado set down in southeast Sherman county near Rockville and was observed for a few minutes.  The next twister was in southwest Howard county near Farwell.  Another tornado was reported by a sheriff's deputy near the junction of Nebraska highways 92 and 11.  These tornadoes were in open county and caused little in the way of damage.  The town of Elba in Howard county has pummeled by large hail for period of time.  Broken windows and trees stripped of leaves were common throughout the small community.  The most destructive tornado occurred near the village of Cushing.  The tornado set down on a farm west of town and damaged several outbuildings and threw irrigation pipe across a field.  The tornado then cut a path across the south end of town, again damaging several outbuildings and some minor damage to a home.  The tornado dissipated just southeast of town.

At the surface a warm frontal boundary extended nearly east to west across the state and provided the focus for thunderstorm development.  By the late afternoon, lifted indices were approaching -10 C. with CAPE values around 5000 J/kg over western Iowa.  Surface temperatures warmed into the upper 80s with dew points in the low to mid 70s.  A southwest surface wind of 15 to 25 kts pushed over the front.  Northeast of the frontal boundary winds were easterly around 10 to 15 kts.  Actually, the surface boundary was further enhanced by outflow from convective complexes during the day, further sharpening the contrast.  Thunderstorms continued to fire along and north of the boundary through the afternoon and into the evening.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding as very heavy rains fell on areas that had had significant rainfall the previous night.  There were reports in north central into northeast Iowa of 2 to 4 inches of rainfall in a little more than an hours time.  Major flooding took place in the Mason City area where evacuations were taking place.  The thunderstorms became most intense during the afternoon into the early evening.  There were several tornadoes across northeast into north central Iowa.  Most were relatively brief touchdowns and were in open areas.  Reports of multi-vortex tornadoes were received from Grundy County.  The days most significant tornado touched down in Pocahontas County east of Rolfe and tracked into Humboldt County through the Bradgate area.  The tornado damaged or destroyed over 75% of the town of Bradgate (pop 120).  Tornado damage in Bradgate was very extensive impacting most of the town.  Hardly a building was not impacted.   Outbuildings, light structures and garages were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Two homes were destroyed.  Several homes were damaged ranging from minor to extensive.  The Survey Team found that the majority of the damage was F1, with a few cases of F2 damage.  The F2 damage was to the snapping of very large trees just west of town and the structural damage to two buildings.  Nearly all of the 53 homes there reported damage with several totally destroyed.  Significant widespread property damage was reported in the tornadoes path.  There were several injuries in the town, the most significant being a broken leg.  A police officer was reportedly hit by debris from the tornado and suffered a broken leg.  According to law officials, the damage path of the tornado was 2 miles wide and about 8 miles long.  Storm chasers on the scene reported the tornado itself to be one half mile wide at one point.  Reports of hail were numerous through the afternoon and evening.  Most of the hail was in the three quarter inch to one inch diameter range.  There were a few reports of golf ball size hail from the stronger storms.  Winds were not a major problem with the activity.  There were spotty reports of winds to around 60 MPH, but most reports were in the 40 to 50 MPH range.  One of the stronger wind reports was a 64 MPH wind gust in Tripoli in Bremer County.  This gust was measured by a mesonet station there.  During the mid evening hours, thunderstorms rumbled across Grundy County.  Lightning struck the Sheriff's office there and destroyed a significant amount of office equipment.  Damage was reported around $100,000.",Several brief touchdowns in open fields around the Holland area.  Track was very intermittent.,PDS

Embedded short-lived tornadoes and intense downbursts caused pockets of severe damage. The single most destructive event was an F-2 tornado that struck Newburgh, Indiana. Another tornado in the northern suburbs of Evansville caused over one million dollars damage. Intense downbursts occurred in eastern Warrick County and southern Spencer County. The downburst in Warrick County occurred south of Tennyson, near the Spencer County line, where hundreds of trees were blown down or damaged. The damage area, which was caused by winds estimated near 85 MPH, was about 3.5 miles long and 50 to 75 yards wide. Little or no damage was reported to residences in this very sparsely populated area. Another larger downburst in southern Spencer County caused more significant damage from Enterprise to Rockport. Estimated winds from 70 to 80 MPH caused lots of damage to trees. The damage area was about 9 miles long and 2 miles wide. Some structures were damaged, and shingles were blown off roofs. Across the remainder of southwest Indiana, numerous trees were blown down across southern Gibson County, and a gust to 60 MPH was measured at St. Philip in Posey County. There were trees and limbs down in Posey County. Sporadic tree damage was reported across Pike County. In Warrick County, in addition to the Newburgh tornado and Tennyson downburst, there were numerous trees and power lines down in Boonville. In Spencer County, trees were blown down countywide.","The tornado first touched down on Bromm Road, then tracked east directly across Darmstadt, finally lifting at Browning Road. Hundreds of trees were blown down, including many that landed on houses and power lines. A total of 42 single family homes, 6 commercial structures, and 1 agricultural structure were affected. One single family home and one business was destroyed. Five single family homes and four commercial buildings received major damage. The remainder of the 42 structures received only minor damage.

A complex weather situation was in place due to the convection from the previous night.  An outflow boundary extended east to west across northern Missouri.  The synoptic frontal boundary extended from central Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The air was clear over Iowa during the day, allowing for temperatures to recover.  Dew point values also recovered quite rapidly with readings in the upper 60s to low 70s by the late afternoon hours.  Lifted indices dropped into the -5 to -10 C. range by evening with CAPE values approaching 5000 J/kg.  By the evening hours, the frontal boundary and outflow boundary had converged and were located along Interstate 80.  Explosive thunderstorm development took place during the very late afternoon and evening hours in spite of the weak shear profile.  Discrete supercells formed in a narrow line along Interstate 80 from near Des Moines on west.  The storms became tornadic quickly.  To add insult to injury, a strong thunderstorm complex formed over Nebraska and moved east along the line of convection over Iowa.  As the event took shape, all modes of severe weather occurred.  The storms developed so rapidly that there was little more than a half hour from the first hail and wind report to the first tornado touchdown.  Hail and high wind reports were too numerous to mention individually here.  Numerous reports of golf ball size hail were received.  Boone and Story Counties reported some of the largest hail with the event as baseball size hail pelted the are.  There was one report of very large hail northwest of Slater in Story County.  Hail five and one half inches in diameter punched 8 holes through a steel roof.  There was severe house siding and roof damage in the area.  There were numerous tornadoes, especially in the central Iowa Iowa.  At one point there were several supercells around the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Two of the stronger tornadoes touched down west and south of Des Moines.  Fortunately, most of the tornado tracks were over open areas and resulted in little damage.  High winds became a problem, especially after sunset, as the complex from Nebraska moved in.  The system became more of a derecho during the late night hours.  Eighty plus MPH winds pelted southwest Iowa and downed barns and several buildings in Adams and Cass Counties.  A beta bow element formed in central Iowa shortly before midnight.  The bow echo produced a measured wind gust of 106 MPH in northern Warren County.  The high winds continued to push east along Interstate 80 for the next hour or so before it started to weaken.  The other major problem was with heavy rain.  The convection from the previous night set the stage by saturating soils.  The echos trained for several hours across central Iowa with very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall rates of 4 to 5 inches per hour were common under the heavier cells.  Several locations received 2 to 5 inch rainfalls in under  two hours, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  Reports of major highways being inundated by water were common.  By the end of the night, a swath of 4 to 9 inch rainfall was evident north of Interstate 80.  Longer term river flooding became a major problem by the morning of the 23rd.  There were two lightning related injuries.  Two people were injured when they were struck by lightning out of doors in Nevada.  The lightning struck close by as they were carrying groceries into their home.  The jolt caused them to fall, resulting in laceration to the head.",Touchdown in open fields south of Garwin.,PDS

This storm began in extreme west central Oklahoma, moved through center sections of the state, and ended in extreme eastern Oklahoma. The storm affected portions of both the Oklahoma City and Tulsa metropolitan areas.","The second tornado of this storm began 3 miles NE of American Horse Lake, or 9 miles WNW of Geary.   This tornado also was obscured by rain for much of its life cycle, but was documented at close range by the Doppler on Wheels (DOW). The center of the tornadic circulation initially moved ESE, approaching American Horse Road around 1824 (all times CST), 6-7 miles WNW of Geary, then turned to the ENE. Damage occurred over a wide swath to the right of the center of circulation, and was the combined result of the tornado and damaging winds from the very strong mesocyclone within which it was embedded. A peak instantaneous wind gust was measured by the DOW at 81 m/s (157 knots, or 181 mph) at a height of 6.5 meters AGL in the mesocyclone circulation just north of Geary at 1836. Four miles NW of Geary, several smaller-scale vortices developed around the initial circulation center - one of which became the dominant circulation and formed about a half a mile south of the original center at 1832.  Due to continuity of the parent mesocyclone circulation and the continuous damage path, these circulation centers are considered to be sub-vortices within the same tornado, and not separate tornadoes. The newly-formed circulation center moved slightly south of due east, and crossed US270/281 at 1837 CST, 2 miles NNW of Geary. The tornado crossed into Canadian County at 1838 CST, 11.8 WNW of Calumet.The tornado caused widespread tree damage with trees downed or uprooted across the area. Several barns were also damaged or destroyed in Blaine county. A house sustained some roof damage and power lines were downed in the area. A stock trailer was found rolled and farm machinery damaged.

Other thunderstorms developed over portions of east central Illinois and northwest Indiana. The major threat was heavy rain which produced widespread street flooding.  There were also reports of thunderstorm wind damage.  The line of thunderstorms continued to march east through northeast Illinois and northwest Indiana and by early afternoon the line had pushed east of the region.  By mid afternoon a second line of thunderstorms crossed the Mississippi river into western Illinois and other storms developed over east central Illinois and northwest Indiana. The storms continued to move through the area into early evening.   The two lines of thunderstorms produced widespread tree damage.  There were also a few reports of lightning damage associated with these storms.  Flash flooding was a serious problem as a considerable amount of rain had fallen recently in addition to heavy rains associated with these storms.  The storms produced several weak tornadoes over Livingston County Illinois.,"This event was a series of short tornado segments south of Pontiac.  It began 8 miles southwest of Pontiac near County Roads 1400 North and 900 East.  A barn roof was torn off and a large tree was snapped near 1000 East.  Trees and limbs were blown down and farm outbuildings were damaged along County Road 1400 North.  The damage ended at Pike Creek about one half mile west of 1200 East, where doors of a shed were blown out.  Additional damage began just east of Interstate 55, north of County Road 1400 North.  Trees and limbs were down at County Road 1325 East and near a nursing home on Old Route 66.  Damage occurred again near County Road 1700 East, north of County Road 1400 North, where a house had roof damage and trees were blown down.  Tree limbs were damaged on County Roads 1775 East and 1800 East.  The most intense damage was on Billet Rd., about 1/2 mile north of County Road 1400 North, near the Vermillion River.  About 1 dozen large trees were snapped in this area.  The damage path was up to 50 yards wide at this point and the tornado was rated F1.

The storms were in the form of short lines or bows as they moved through Jefferson, Perry, and Jackson Counties, including Mount Vernon and Carbondale. A couple of tornadoes were spawned in those areas. As the storms moved east, they evolved into an intense squall line, producing widespread damaging gusts around 60 MPH with isolated higher gusts to 90 MPH. Numerous trees were blown down in nearly every county. Some of the trees fell on roads and power lines. In Wayne County, trees and utility poles were down in Sims, but the northwest part of the county from Orchardville to Johnsonville was hardest hit with utility damage. In Hamilton County, the whole city of Mcleansboro was without power after numerous trees fell. Several of the trees landed on houses, causing severe damage to at least one house. Trees fell on vehicles in Mount Carmel, where gusts were reported to 68 MPH. At least two occupied vehicles were struck by falling trees, one on Route 34 north of Harrisburg, and another north of Old Shawneetown. In both cases, the occupants were freed by rescue workers without being injured. In Harrisburg, trees fell on several houses and vehicles, and a radio tower used for fire dispatch operations was blown down. Two roofs were blown off of houses in Raleigh, just north of Harrisburg. A tree fell on a house in Thebes, near the Mississippi River in Alexander County. The most intense winds (estimated near 90 MPH) occurred in Massac County about 5 miles west of Round Knob, where a house lost portions of its roof and attic. At least 10 to 15 trees were reported down in Massac County. The storms produced very heavy rain that caused street flooding. The U.S. Highway 51 overpass on the north side of Cairo was blocked by high water.","The tornado began on Bethel Church Road and ended at the Washington County line near where U.S. Highway 51 crosses the county line. Five barns were destroyed directly by wind. Other damage was due mostly to trees falling on buildings. At least four residences were moderately damaged. A machinery storage building and sheds were demolished. An airplane hangar was destroyed. Numerous trees were blown down, blocking some roads.

Significant damage was reported in northwest King George, east Stafford, and  northeast Spotsylvania Counties. In King George County, an F1 tornado touched down near Shiloh. At least a dozen dwelling, and 10 boats were damaged.  The boats were stored in dry dock in the Waugh Marina. Several trees were also uprooted or topped out along the storms three mile path.  In Stafford County, 80 to 90 mph winds destroyed two homes caused major damage to twenty others. The Japazawas Subdivision Eastern  Stafford County had about 40 felled trees.  Three Amtrak trains were stalled between the Chatham area of Stafford and Fredericksburg due to downed trees and power lines. Finally, in the City of Spotsylvania, Spotsylvania County, the main stage at the re-enactment of the Battle of Spotsylvania collapsed due to strong winds.

A complex weather situation was in place due to the convection from the previous night.  An outflow boundary extended east to west across northern Missouri.  The synoptic frontal boundary extended from central Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The air was clear over Iowa during the day, allowing for temperatures to recover.  Dew point values also recovered quite rapidly with readings in the upper 60s to low 70s by the late afternoon hours.  Lifted indices dropped into the -5 to -10 C. range by evening with CAPE values approaching 5000 J/kg.  By the evening hours, the frontal boundary and outflow boundary had converged and were located along Interstate 80.  Explosive thunderstorm development took place during the very late afternoon and evening hours in spite of the weak shear profile.  Discrete supercells formed in a narrow line along Interstate 80 from near Des Moines on west.  The storms became tornadic quickly.  To add insult to injury, a strong thunderstorm complex formed over Nebraska and moved east along the line of convection over Iowa.  As the event took shape, all modes of severe weather occurred.  The storms developed so rapidly that there was little more than a half hour from the first hail and wind report to the first tornado touchdown.  Hail and high wind reports were too numerous to mention individually here.  Numerous reports of golf ball size hail were received.  Boone and Story Counties reported some of the largest hail with the event as baseball size hail pelted the are.  There was one report of very large hail northwest of Slater in Story County.  Hail five and one half inches in diameter punched 8 holes through a steel roof.  There was severe house siding and roof damage in the area.  There were numerous tornadoes, especially in the central Iowa Iowa.  At one point there were several supercells around the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Two of the stronger tornadoes touched down west and south of Des Moines.  Fortunately, most of the tornado tracks were over open areas and resulted in little damage.  High winds became a problem, especially after sunset, as the complex from Nebraska moved in.  The system became more of a derecho during the late night hours.  Eighty plus MPH winds pelted southwest Iowa and downed barns and several buildings in Adams and Cass Counties.  A beta bow element formed in central Iowa shortly before midnight.  The bow echo produced a measured wind gust of 106 MPH in northern Warren County.  The high winds continued to push east along Interstate 80 for the next hour or so before it started to weaken.  The other major problem was with heavy rain.  The convection from the previous night set the stage by saturating soils.  The echos trained for several hours across central Iowa with very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall rates of 4 to 5 inches per hour were common under the heavier cells.  Several locations received 2 to 5 inch rainfalls in under  two hours, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  Reports of major highways being inundated by water were common.  By the end of the night, a swath of 4 to 9 inch rainfall was evident north of Interstate 80.  Longer term river flooding became a major problem by the morning of the 23rd.

Other thunderstorms developed over portions of east central Illinois and northwest Indiana. The major threat was heavy rain which produced widespread street flooding.  There were also reports of thunderstorm wind damage.  The line of thunderstorms continued to march east through northeast Illinois and northwest Indiana and by early afternoon the line had pushed east of the region.  By mid afternoon a second line of thunderstorms crossed the Mississippi river into western Illinois and other storms developed over east central Illinois and northwest Indiana. The storms continued to move through the area into early evening.   The two lines of thunderstorms produced widespread tree damage.  There were also a few reports of lightning damage associated with these storms.  Flash flooding was a serious problem as a considerable amount of rain had fallen recently in addition to heavy rains associated with these storms.  The storms produced several weak tornadoes over Livingston County Illinois.,"A brief, narrow tornado occurred along a 1 mile path on County Road 1700 North, from County Road 3100 East to about 3200 East.

It damaged a few sheds and buildings in Riceville, with mainly tin roofing material and siding blown off.  The tornado lifted in Riceville and was rated an F0.The third and most significant tornado formed about 2 miles north of Riceville, again just east of the Mitchell-Howard County line.  The tornado tracked north, just east of the county line or Addison Avenue.  It grew in strength and at one point was approximately 150 yards wide, hitting several homes and farms (F2 damage).  One home lost the roof and all buildings.  The tornado was so close to the county line that debris was thrown across Addison Avenue into Mitchell County at times.  The dirt and young crops were scoured by the tornado.  The tornado crossed into Minnesota just southwest of Le Roy (Mower County), hitting a home directly on the state line.  The home, which was built in1900, and several buildings on the lot, were completely demolished (F3 damage).",,PDS

The first tornado touched down  about 1.5 miles north of Taylor (Jackson County) around 6:22 p.m.  It caused intermittent damage during the first two miles of its path as it moved east southeastward across Highway 95.  It then strengthened and stayed on the ground for another 3 miles.  Many trees were knocked down, and it also demolished a garage and took the roof off two other structures. The tornado reached F1 strength (estimated 75-85 mph winds) briefly as it moved through the Davis and Taylor Road areas where it demolished a garage approximately 2 miles northeast of Taylor. This tornado appeared to lift approximately 4 miles east of Taylor around 6:28 p.m. About 3 tenths of a mile to the south of where the first tornado lifted, a second tornado formed. This tornado primarily caused tree damage. Shortly after formation, it reached F1 strength (estimated 80-100 mph winds), clearing out a path about 30 yards wide through a wooded area just north of West Pine Creek Road. This tornado weakened about 5 miles east of Taylor, but caused sporadic F0 damage until it finally lifted around 6:32 p.m. about 8 miles east of Taylor in the East Pine Creek Road area.  Total path length of these two tornadoes was nearly 9 miles. They were on the ground for about 10 minutes. A third tornado quickly developed about 3 miles west of Warrens (Monroe County) near Arctic Road, just west of Interstate 94 around 7:00 p.m.  It hit a home along Interstate 94, then crossed the Interstate hitting a semi-truck, before moving into Jellystone Campground just west of Warrens.  The tornado and associated strong winds around the storm knocked down hundreds of trees in this area, and damaged several tents, buildings, campers, and cars in Jellystone Campground.  One gentleman was seriously injured when a tree fell on him during a rescue attempt.  He was in a coma for a period of time, but survived with lasting disabilities.  The tornado continued just southwest of Warrens and hit a home, blowing the roof off, south of the village along County Road O.  It lifted about 2 miles southeast of Warrens around 7:12 p.m.  The tornado path was approximately 4.5 miles in total length, with a maximum width of 50 yards. The tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Damage Scale. Wind speeds were likely 90 to 112 mph, with most of the damage related to downburst winds around the actual tornado.  At least 3 people were hospitalized briefly for injuries, but there no fatalities. The fourth tornado formed in extreme eastern Juneau County, about 2 miles west of Castle Rock Dam. The tornado moved east-northeast across Castle Rock Lake and into western Adams County.  It tracked near or along Edgewood Ave, with extensive tree damage to the Quincy Bluff area, including the lookout ranger tower there. Hundreds of trees were blown down from strong winds rotating around the tornadic thunderstorm, which were in excess of 90 mph at times.  The tornado intermittently tracked east to areas just north of Edgewood Drive crossing Highway 13 approximately 5 miles south of Adams/Friendship (Adams County).  Downburst winds on the south side of the storm demolished at least 8 mobile homes in Edgewood Estates that were orientated north-south and took the full brunt of the cross wind.  This was the same area hit by severe weather in September 2000.  Most of the Town of Easton (Adams County) had extensive damage with hundreds of trees down.  It continued to move east-southeast before lifting shortly before the Adams-Marquette County line about 3 miles southeast of Grand Marsh around 7:55 pm.  A broad area of straight line wind damage was found south of this tornado track with widespread tree damage occurring up to 1 mile south of the track.

At least 3 people were hospitalized briefly for injuries, but there no fatalities. The fourth tornado formed in extreme eastern Juneau County, about 2 miles west of Castle Rock Dam. The tornado moved east-northeast across Castle Rock Lake and into western Adams County.  It tracked near or along Edgewood Ave, with extensive tree damage to the Quincy Bluff area, including the lookout ranger tower there. Hundreds of trees were blown down from strong winds rotating around the tornadic thunderstorm, which were in excess of 90 mph at times.  The tornado intermittently tracked east to areas just north of Edgewood Drive crossing Highway 13 approximately 5 miles south of Adams/Friendship (Adams County).  Downburst winds on the south side of the storm demolished at least 8 mobile homes in Edgewood Estates that were orientated north-south and took the full brunt of the cross wind.  This was the same area hit by severe weather in September 2000.  Most of the Town of Easton (Adams County) had extensive damage with hundreds of trees down.  It continued to move east-southeast before lifting shortly before the Adams-Marquette County line about 3 miles southeast of Grand Marsh around 7:55 pm.  A broad area of straight line wind damage was found south of this tornado track with widespread tree damage occurring up to 1 mile south of the track.  The tornado path was approximately 17 to 18 miles in length. The tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Damage Scale with estimated wind speeds in the 73 to 112 mph range.",,PDS

The monthly rainfall ranged from a low of4.08 inches in Eastland County to 20.02 inches at Hudson Oaks in Parker County.  Many locations had twice their normal rainfall for the month.  The DFW Airport had the second wettest June on Record, and had measurable rain 18 days, the most days in any month with measurable rain.  These heavy rains produced periodic flash flooding somewhere in North Central Texas nearly every day of the month.  The month began with a northwest flow event on the 1st, with a large hp supercell producing large hail from Jack County southeast to Parker County.  The storm had an erratic southeast movement, but when the storm entered Northern Parker County, it made a left turn and moved nearly due east through Tarrant County, producing countywide wind damage, with measured winds up to 86 miles an hour at the Meacham Airport, some large hail, and flash flood producing rains.   This became the most destructive storm in Tarrant County since the Mayfest Storm on May 5, 1995.  TXU Electric had their worst power outages in the Companies history, as over 500,000 people were without electricity, some for as long as 5 days.  They had to bring in work crews from out of state to help restore power.    Damage estimates for Tarrant County were well over $100,000,000 from this storm.

A cold front sank into northern Iowa during the afternoon.  Numerous outflow boundaries were located over the state from previous convection as well.  Temperatures rose into the mid 80s to low 90s, while dew point readings soared into the upper 70s to low 80s.  By late afternoon, lifted indices were around -15 C., with CAPE values in the 6000 to 8000 J/kg range.  During the day, a strong MCS tracked east across southern Minnesota.  Thunderstorms developed to the southwest of the MCS as it passed and it's outflow boundary interacted with the unstable airmass.  Thunderstorms erupted very quickly during the late afternoon and evening hours.  The main mode of severe weather from the storms was in the form of high winds.  Winds gusted to between 60 and 80 MPH in several locations.  Strong straight line winds blasted the south half of Marshall County, causing considerable damage in the Marshalltown area as well as areas to the south.  There were spotty reports of hail with the system.  Freezing levels being around 15000 feet AGL helped to limit hail size.  The largest reports were of golf ball size hail, though most of the hail was in inch or less in diameter.  There were a few tornadoes during the late afternoon.  One tornado touched down briefly in Hardin County.  Though it tracked through rural areas, it did cause some structural damage to outbuildings and a house south of Radcliffe.  One of the stronger tornadoes of the day touched down near Albion in Marshall County.  The tornado was on the ground for several miles.  Fortunately, it traveled through rural areas and resulted in little damage.  High winds around the supercell associated with the tornado caused much more damage in the form of straight line winds.  Another tornado touched down in Story County northeast of Zearing.  The tornado tracked southeast along its 3 mile long damage path.  The path was about 100 yards wide.  Thirty to forty trees were damaged or destroyed and one outbuilding was destroyed.  Several head of livestock were killed with the outbuilding was destroyed.  There was also significant crop damage along the path of the storm.  High winds also caused damage in Franklin County in the Bradford area.  Two grain bins were destroyed by the high winds.  Flash flooding became an issue by the evening.  Very heavy rainfall fell in areas that had received significant rainfall during the previous 48 hours.  Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches in less than three hours caused flash flooding in Dallas, Warren, and Decatur Counties.  As the thunderstorms moved through Iowa Falls, lightning struck the Police dispatch office, blowing out all of the switching equipment in the building.  Lightning struck a house in Pella during the evening.  It caused damage throughout the house as all of the wiring in the house was destroyed by the surge of electricity.  Several appliances were also destroyed by the strike.  Another house was struck by lightning in Wayne County in Corydon.  The house was set on fire, totally destroying the top story of a two story home.  In Mahaska County, lightning struck a house in Oskaloosa.  The house was started on fire.  The people in the house escaped, however the family dog was seen by firemen in the window of the house.  They were unable to reach her.  Amazingly, the dog found shelter in the shower and firemen were able to rescue her once the fire was extinguished.  The dog was treated and released.  Damage to the house was limited to smoke and water damage.",Tornado touched down near Albion and tracked into notheast Marshall County.  Tree and structural damage was reported along the path.,PDS

Thunderstorms erupted over north central into northeast Iowa initially.  Inflow to the thunderstorms was in the 15 to 30 kt range.  Farther west, inflow was under 10 KTS, which limited thunderstorm development.  Intense thunderstorms formed over Franklin, Butler, and Hardin Counties.   One of the storms produced tornadoes over Franklin and Hardin Counties.  One tornado touched down in rural Franklin County and crossed the border into Hardin County.  A second tornado touched to the west and south of Ackley in Hardin County.  This tornado also touched down in rural areas and caused little damage.  High winds swept through Ackley as the storms moved through.  There were several reports of hail of nickle to ping ball size.  The storms trained over Butler and Hardin Counties.  Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches in a two to three hour period resulted in flash flooding over southwest Butler, northeast Grundy,  and northeast Hardin Counties.  Later in the evening thunderstorms formed along the outflow of the convection in northeast Iowa.

Surface dew points rose into the mid to upper 70s along with surface temperatures near 90.  Soundings indicated CAPE values around 5000 J/kg with lifted indices in the -9 C. range.  The freezing level was relatively low, being a little over 12,000 feet.  A steep lapse rate was in place with a 7 to 8 C. lapse rate between 850 and 500 mb.  At the same time, a strong west to southwest jet in excess of 75 kts was in place over the central U.S.  During the afternoon, a cold front dropped southeast into the state.  Thunderstorms erupted during the late afternoon in advance of the cold front.  The storms became severe very quickly and produced high winds and hail.  There were a few tornadoes reported with the stronger storms.  They touched down in open countryside and resulted in little damage.  One tornado northwest of Maxwell in Story County tracked across the north end of a farmstead there.  Several trees were downed and one window was blown out of the farm house.  A tornado touched down in Marshall County south of Melbourne.  The tornado may have actually been three separate tornadoes that developed and dissipated very rapidly.  It was hard to distinguish if there were three, or if the damage path was produced by vortices rotating around the parent storm.  There were three areas along the path of more noticeable damage.  One was of F0 strength, the other two areas were F1 strength.  The entire event took place in about 5 minutes.   High winds and hail were widespread during the event.  There was some very impressive hail reported.  Very large hail of five and one half inches in diameter fell in Hancock County in the Kanawha area.  Incredibly, three inch diameter hail fell in the same area about 30 minutes before the very large hail hit.  The hail resulted in considerable vehicle and home damage in the area.  There were reports of baseball size hail in Pocahontas County near Gilmore City.  Reports from Sac County indicated two and one half inch diameter hail in the town of Odebolt.  The hail did considerable damage in the city, including smashing out the windows in several homes and smashing car windshields.  Most of the other hail reported around the state was golf ball and smaller size.  Many of the storms produced high winds, resulting in a lot of tree and power line damage.  Storms in central Iowa produced 60 to 75 MPH winds, resulting in many cars being blown off highways in central Iowa.  Flash flooding occurred in Davis County as heavy rainfall of 3 to 4 inches fell on the already saturated county.  This weather system was the third heavy rainfall to hit the county in as many days.  County officials reported numerous roads closed to flowing water over the highways, even as sunrise approached.",Tornado tracked through the north end of a farmstead resulting in tree damage.

A cold front sank into northern Iowa during the afternoon.  Numerous outflow boundaries were located over the state from previous convection as well.  Temperatures rose into the mid 80s to low 90s, while dew point readings soared into the upper 70s to low 80s.  By late afternoon, lifted indices were around -15 C., with CAPE values in the 6000 to 8000 J/kg range.  During the day, a strong MCS tracked east across southern Minnesota.  Thunderstorms developed to the southwest of the MCS as it passed and it's outflow boundary interacted with the unstable airmass.  Thunderstorms erupted very quickly during the late afternoon and evening hours.  The main mode of severe weather from the storms was in the form of high winds.  Winds gusted to between 60 and 80 MPH in several locations.  Strong straight line winds blasted the south half of Marshall County, causing considerable damage in the Marshalltown area as well as areas to the south.  There were spotty reports of hail with the system.  Freezing levels being around 15000 feet AGL helped to limit hail size.  The largest reports were of golf ball size hail, though most of the hail was in inch or less in diameter.  There were a few tornadoes during the late afternoon.  One tornado touched down briefly in Hardin County.  Though it tracked through rural areas, it did cause some structural damage to outbuildings and a house south of Radcliffe.  One of the stronger tornadoes of the day touched down near Albion in Marshall County.  The tornado was on the ground for several miles.  Fortunately, it traveled through rural areas and resulted in little damage.  High winds around the supercell associated with the tornado caused much more damage in the form of straight line winds.  Another tornado touched down in Story County northeast of Zearing.  The tornado tracked southeast along its 3 mile long damage path.  The path was about 100 yards wide.  Thirty to forty trees were damaged or destroyed and one outbuilding was destroyed.  Several head of livestock were killed with the outbuilding was destroyed.  There was also significant crop damage along the path of the storm.  High winds also caused damage in Franklin County in the Bradford area.  Two grain bins were destroyed by the high winds.  Flash flooding became an issue by the evening.  Very heavy rainfall fell in areas that had received significant rainfall during the previous 48 hours.  Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches in less than three hours caused flash flooding in Dallas, Warren, and Decatur Counties.  As the thunderstorms moved through Iowa Falls, lightning struck the Police dispatch office, blowing out all of the switching equipment in the building.  Lightning struck a house in Pella during the evening.  It caused damage throughout the house as all of the wiring in the house was destroyed by the surge of electricity.  Several appliances were also destroyed by the strike.  Another house was struck by lightning in Wayne County in Corydon.  The house was set on fire, totally destroying the top story of a two story home.  In Mahaska County, lightning struck a house in Oskaloosa.  The house was started on fire.  The people in the house escaped, however the family dog was seen by firemen in the window of the house.  They were unable to reach her.  Amazingly, the dog found shelter in the shower and firemen were able to rescue her once the fire was extinguished.  The dog was treated and released.  Damage to the house was limited to smoke and water damage.",Tornado tracked across fields northeast of Zearing and damaged buildings and crops.,PDS

The monthly rainfall ranged from a low of4.08 inches in Eastland County to 20.02 inches at Hudson Oaks in Parker County.  Many locations had twice their normal rainfall for the month.  The DFW Airport had the second wettest June on Record, and had measurable rain 18 days, the most days in any month with measurable rain.  These heavy rains produced periodic flash flooding somewhere in North Central Texas nearly every day of the month.  The month began with a northwest flow event on the 1st, with a large hp supercell producing large hail from Jack County southeast to Parker County.  The storm had an erratic southeast movement, but when the storm entered Northern Parker County, it made a left turn and moved nearly due east through Tarrant County, producing countywide wind damage, with measured winds up to 86 miles an hour at the Meacham Airport, some large hail, and flash flood producing rains.   This became the most destructive storm in Tarrant County since the Mayfest Storm on May 5, 1995.  TXU Electric had their worst power outages in the Companies history, as over 500,000 people were without electricity, some for as long as 5 days.  They had to bring in work crews from out of state to help restore power.    Damage estimates for Tarrant County were well over $100,000,000 from this storm.

Surface dew points rose into the mid to upper 70s along with surface temperatures near 90.  Soundings indicated CAPE values around 5000 J/kg with lifted indices in the -9 C. range.  The freezing level was relatively low, being a little over 12,000 feet.  A steep lapse rate was in place with a 7 to 8 C. lapse rate between 850 and 500 mb.  At the same time, a strong west to southwest jet in excess of 75 kts was in place over the central U.S.  During the afternoon, a cold front dropped southeast into the state.  Thunderstorms erupted during the late afternoon in advance of the cold front.  The storms became severe very quickly and produced high winds and hail.  There were a few tornadoes reported with the stronger storms.  They touched down in open countryside and resulted in little damage.  One tornado northwest of Maxwell in Story County tracked across the north end of a farmstead there.  Several trees were downed and one window was blown out of the farm house.  A tornado touched down in Marshall County south of Melbourne.  The tornado may have actually been three separate tornadoes that developed and dissipated very rapidly.  It was hard to distinguish if there were three, or if the damage path was produced by vortices rotating around the parent storm.  There were three areas along the path of more noticeable damage.  One was of F0 strength, the other two areas were F1 strength.  The entire event took place in about 5 minutes.   High winds and hail were widespread during the event.  There was some very impressive hail reported.  Very large hail of five and one half inches in diameter fell in Hancock County in the Kanawha area.  Incredibly, three inch diameter hail fell in the same area about 30 minutes before the very large hail hit.  The hail resulted in considerable vehicle and home damage in the area.  There were reports of baseball size hail in Pocahontas County near Gilmore City.  Reports from Sac County indicated two and one half inch diameter hail in the town of Odebolt.  The hail did considerable damage in the city, including smashing out the windows in several homes and smashing car windshields.  Most of the other hail reported around the state was golf ball and smaller size.  Many of the storms produced high winds, resulting in a lot of tree and power line damage.  Storms in central Iowa produced 60 to 75 MPH winds, resulting in many cars being blown off highways in central Iowa.  Flash flooding occurred in Davis County as heavy rainfall of 3 to 4 inches fell on the already saturated county.  This weather system was the third heavy rainfall to hit the county in as many days.  County officials reported numerous roads closed to flowing water over the highways, even as sunrise approached.",Tornado touched down in open fields north of Humboldt and caused little damage.,PDS

The tornado traveled southeast for about 2.5 miles, before beginning a temporary eastward jog between county roads 1300E and 1400E. The tornado curved southeast again, striking the Parsons Company, Inc.'s manufacturing plant around 241 pm CDT.  The plant was severely damaged by the tornado.  Approximately 140 people were in the plant at the time, but all personnel made it to storm shelters in time (approximately 3 to 5 minutes before the tornado arrived).  Steel beams and metal siding from the plant were found approximately three quarters of a mile east in a farm field. From the plant, the tornado continued east, just south of Illinois Route 116/117, affecting 4 farmsteads approximately 1/2 to 1 mile east of the plant.  Two of the farmsteads closest to the plant (about 1/2 to 3/4 mile east) had the 2-story houses completely blown away, with only debris remaining in the basements and nearby property.  The other two farmsteads had significant damage to the 2-story houses with outbuildings demolished.  The center of the tornado tracked about 100 yards south of the houses located on the south side of the road.From the plant to the farmsteads, the average width of the tornado was 400 yards and was close to 1/4 mile wide at times.  The greatest tornado intensity was during this approximately 1 mile stretch and has been rated F4 by the National Weather Service.At this point, the tornado began to move more east-southeast and caused significant damage to a barn near the intersection of County Roads 1300N and 1600E, about 2.5 miles southwest of Roanoke.

Temperatures warmed into the low to mid 80s south of the front with dew point readings around 70 degrees.  CAPE values by late afternoon were in the 2200 J/kg range with lifted indices in the -4 to -5 degree range.  Thunderstorms developed by the early afternoon hours.  Most of the storms remained well below severe limits.  There were a couple exceptions.  One storm produced a microburst southwest of Adel in Dallas County.  IT downed a narrow area of two to three foot diameter trees.  Another storm in Calhoun produced a small tornado north of Rockwell City.  The tornado touched down in open country and did not cause any damage to speak of.  The main threat with the thunderstorms through the afternoon and evening hours was the heavy rainfall north of the warm front.  Rainfall of 2 to 5 inches was reported across the north quarter of the state.  Heavy rainfall caused flash flooding in Cerro Gordo County in the Mason City area.  Widespread 2 to 3 inch amounts were reported in the city on top of already saturated ground, resulting in flash flooding.

Surface dew points rose into the mid to upper 70s along with surface temperatures near 90.  Soundings indicated CAPE values around 5000 J/kg with lifted indices in the -9 C. range.  The freezing level was relatively low, being a little over 12,000 feet.  A steep lapse rate was in place with a 7 to 8 C. lapse rate between 850 and 500 mb.  At the same time, a strong west to southwest jet in excess of 75 kts was in place over the central U.S.  During the afternoon, a cold front dropped southeast into the state.  Thunderstorms erupted during the late afternoon in advance of the cold front.  The storms became severe very quickly and produced high winds and hail.  There were a few tornadoes reported with the stronger storms.  They touched down in open countryside and resulted in little damage.  One tornado northwest of Maxwell in Story County tracked across the north end of a farmstead there.  Several trees were downed and one window was blown out of the farm house.  A tornado touched down in Marshall County south of Melbourne.  The tornado may have actually been three separate tornadoes that developed and dissipated very rapidly.  It was hard to distinguish if there were three, or if the damage path was produced by vortices rotating around the parent storm.  There were three areas along the path of more noticeable damage.  One was of F0 strength, the other two areas were F1 strength.  The entire event took place in about 5 minutes.   High winds and hail were widespread during the event.  There was some very impressive hail reported.  Very large hail of five and one half inches in diameter fell in Hancock County in the Kanawha area.  Incredibly, three inch diameter hail fell in the same area about 30 minutes before the very large hail hit.  The hail resulted in considerable vehicle and home damage in the area.  There were reports of baseball size hail in Pocahontas County near Gilmore City.  Reports from Sac County indicated two and one half inch diameter hail in the town of Odebolt.  The hail did considerable damage in the city, including smashing out the windows in several homes and smashing car windshields.  Most of the other hail reported around the state was golf ball and smaller size.  Many of the storms produced high winds, resulting in a lot of tree and power line damage.  Storms in central Iowa produced 60 to 75 MPH winds, resulting in many cars being blown off highways in central Iowa.  Flash flooding occurred in Davis County as heavy rainfall of 3 to 4 inches fell on the already saturated county.  This weather system was the third heavy rainfall to hit the county in as many days.

Surface dew points rose into the mid to upper 70s along with surface temperatures near 90.  Soundings indicated CAPE values around 5000 J/kg with lifted indices in the -9 C. range.  The freezing level was relatively low, being a little over 12,000 feet.  A steep lapse rate was in place with a 7 to 8 C. lapse rate between 850 and 500 mb.  At the same time, a strong west to southwest jet in excess of 75 kts was in place over the central U.S.  During the afternoon, a cold front dropped southeast into the state.  Thunderstorms erupted during the late afternoon in advance of the cold front.  The storms became severe very quickly and produced high winds and hail.  There were a few tornadoes reported with the stronger storms.  They touched down in open countryside and resulted in little damage.  One tornado northwest of Maxwell in Story County tracked across the north end of a farmstead there.  Several trees were downed and one window was blown out of the farm house.  A tornado touched down in Marshall County south of Melbourne.  The tornado may have actually been three separate tornadoes that developed and dissipated very rapidly.  It was hard to distinguish if there were three, or if the damage path was produced by vortices rotating around the parent storm.  There were three areas along the path of more noticeable damage.  One was of F0 strength, the other two areas were F1 strength.  The entire event took place in about 5 minutes.   High winds and hail were widespread during the event.  There was some very impressive hail reported.  Very large hail of five and one half inches in diameter fell in Hancock County in the Kanawha area.  Incredibly, three inch diameter hail fell in the same area about 30 minutes before the very large hail hit.  The hail resulted in considerable vehicle and home damage in the area.  There were reports of baseball size hail in Pocahontas County near Gilmore City.  Reports from Sac County indicated two and one half inch diameter hail in the town of Odebolt.  The hail did considerable damage in the city, including smashing out the windows in several homes and smashing car windshields.  Most of the other hail reported around the state was golf ball and smaller size.  Many of the storms produced high winds, resulting in a lot of tree and power line damage.  Storms in central Iowa produced 60 to 75 MPH winds, resulting in many cars being blown off highways in central Iowa.  Flash flooding occurred in Davis County as heavy rainfall of 3 to 4 inches fell on the already saturated county.  This weather system was the third heavy rainfall to hit the county in as many days.  County officials reported numerous roads closed to flowing water over the highways, even as sunrise approached.",Tornado had an intermittent track and may have infact been three tornadoes that developed in rapid succesion.,PDS

A cold front sank into northern Iowa during the afternoon.  Numerous outflow boundaries were located over the state from previous convection as well.  Temperatures rose into the mid 80s to low 90s, while dew point readings soared into the upper 70s to low 80s.  By late afternoon, lifted indices were around -15 C., with CAPE values in the 6000 to 8000 J/kg range.  During the day, a strong MCS tracked east across southern Minnesota.  Thunderstorms developed to the southwest of the MCS as it passed and it's outflow boundary interacted with the unstable airmass.  Thunderstorms erupted very quickly during the late afternoon and evening hours.  The main mode of severe weather from the storms was in the form of high winds.  Winds gusted to between 60 and 80 MPH in several locations.  Strong straight line winds blasted the south half of Marshall County, causing considerable damage in the Marshalltown area as well as areas to the south.  There were spotty reports of hail with the system.  Freezing levels being around 15000 feet AGL helped to limit hail size.  The largest reports were of golf ball size hail, though most of the hail was in inch or less in diameter.  There were a few tornadoes during the late afternoon.  One tornado touched down briefly in Hardin County.  Though it tracked through rural areas, it did cause some structural damage to outbuildings and a house south of Radcliffe.  One of the stronger tornadoes of the day touched down near Albion in Marshall County.  The tornado was on the ground for several miles.  Fortunately, it traveled through rural areas and resulted in little damage.  High winds around the supercell associated with the tornado caused much more damage in the form of straight line winds.  Another tornado touched down in Story County northeast of Zearing.  The tornado tracked southeast along its 3 mile long damage path.  The path was about 100 yards wide.  Thirty to forty trees were damaged or destroyed and one outbuilding was destroyed.  Several head of livestock were killed with the outbuilding was destroyed.  There was also significant crop damage along the path of the storm.  High winds also caused damage in Franklin County in the Bradford area.  Two grain bins were destroyed by the high winds.  Flash flooding became an issue by the evening.  Very heavy rainfall fell in areas that had received significant rainfall during the previous 48 hours.  Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches in less than three hours caused flash flooding in Dallas, Warren, and Decatur Counties.  As the thunderstorms moved through Iowa Falls, lightning struck the Police dispatch office, blowing out all of the switching equipment in the building.  Lightning struck a house in Pella during the evening.  It caused damage throughout the house as all of the wiring in the house was destroyed by the surge of electricity.  Several appliances were also destroyed by the strike.  Another house was struck by lightning in Wayne County in Corydon.  The house was set on fire, totally destroying the top story of a two story home.  In Mahaska County, lightning struck a house in Oskaloosa.  The house was started on fire.  The people in the house escaped, however the family dog was seen by firemen in the window of the house.  They were unable to reach her.  Amazingly, the dog found shelter in the shower and firemen were able to rescue her once the fire was extinguished.  The dog was treated and released.

It tracked north, primarily in open fields, and lifted between 350th and 360th Street east of New Haven, or just west of Windfall Avenue.  The tornado was rated an F1.The second tornado touched down just east of the Mitchell-Howard County line, about 4 miles south of Riceville (Howard County), and also moved straight north.  It downed a few trees, but primarily crossed open fields until it reached the southeast side of Riceville.  It damaged a few sheds and buildings in Riceville, with mainly tin roofing material and siding blown off.  The tornado lifted in Riceville and was rated an F0.The third and most significant tornado formed about 2 miles north of Riceville, again just east of the Mitchell-Howard County line.  The tornado tracked north, just east of the county line or Addison Avenue.  It grew in strength and at one point was approximately 150 yards wide, hitting several homes and farms (F2 damage).  One home lost the roof and all buildings.  The tornado was so close to the county line that debris was thrown across Addison Avenue into Mitchell County at times.  The dirt and young crops were scoured by the tornado.  The tornado crossed into Minnesota just southwest of Le Roy (Mower County), hitting a home directly on the state line.

The 2nd round of severe weather was dominated by 2 cyclic supercells - one moved east/southeast through Marquette, Green Lake, Fond du Lac, and Washington Counties, spinning up 5 separate tornadoes, dumping hail stones up to 3 inches in diameter, and hurricane-force downburst winds.  The large hail dented several vehicles.  Two of these were rated F3.  Refer to the individual tornado reports for more details.  A more southerly supercell tracked across extreme southern Sauk County and then made a partial right turn and headed southeast through Dane County, spinning up 2 tornadoes in the process, as well as large hail and downburst winds.  One powerful downburst wind in Madison (Dane Co.) blew equipment off the roof of a business at the Midvale Shopping Mall.  A semi southwest of Ft. Atkinson was blown over by straight-line wind gusts.  This southern supercell eventually spun up another tornado in south-central Jefferson County which moved into north-central Walworth County.  Refer to the individual tornado reports for more details.Both supercells had downbursts that generated large hail and powerful, hurricane-force winds north and south of their tracks.  Over all of Wisconsin, 16 tornadoes were documented on June 23rd, which is the 4th highest single-day total (record is 24 on May 8, 1988).

It maintained its F3 strength (175-200 mph) and moved east along Marshview Rd, only to merge with the F3 tornado moving east/southeast out of the Markesan area of southeast Green Lake County.  The merger took place just east of a dogleg/bend of Oak Grove Rd., about 2.2 miles SSW of Alto.  The civil Town of Alto reported that 8 residential homes had major damage.

The tornado damage was classified as F1 at two locations: on Summer Street in Franklin and in a subdivision between Lake Pearl and Lake Archer. Wind speeds were estimated at 90 mph in these areas. Tall oak and pine trees were snapped and uprooted at their bases. Many large trees landed on houses throughout Wrentham causing additional damage. The remainder of the tornado's track was considered as F0 with estimated wind speeds of 70 mph. The path width ranged from as narrow as 40 feet to as wide as 120 feet, or 40 yards. One eyewitness near the initial touchdown site saw trees swirling around in mid-air from the front window of her home and heard an unusual roaring sound. No injuries were reported.The same thunderstorm which spawned the tornado weakened as it moved across central and eastern Norfolk County, but downed several trees from Foxborough to Walpole, Sharon and Dedham.

Up to 15 inches of rainfall was observed over northern Goliad County which resulted in Flash Flooding along Perdido, Coleto, and Spring Creeks.  Flooding along the Garcitas Creek and Guadalupe River also resulted from this significant rainfall.  Several high water rescues were performed as motorists attemped to cross flooded roadways. Strong thunderstorms erupted along a nearly stationary frontal boundary that extended across south Texas from near Cotulla to Three Rivers and Victoria Saturday evening (Nov 20). Moist, southerly winds off the Gulf of Mexico in the lower levels of the atmosphere fueled the storms along the front. Meanwhile, in the middle to upper level portions of the atmosphere, winds were nearly parallel to the frontal boundary out of the southwest. This combination caused thunderstorms to regenerate and train over the same areas Saturday evening through early afternoon on Sunday.In all, doppler radar estimated 10 to 15 inches of rain fell in an 18 hour period beginning Saturday afternoon across northern Goliad County from Charco east to Schroeder and near Coletto Creek Reservoir. This was confirmed by reliable rain gauge reports north of Goliad. In addition, rainfall totals across portions of northwest and central Victoria County reached 5 to 10 inches during this period. Emergency management in both counties reported widespread, major flooding problems with numerous road closers. Several motorists were rescued as they became stranded in rising water. County officials and a NWS Storm Survey reported that several homes were flooded and some bridges across northeast Goliad County were washed out by severe flood waters.This rainfall led to daily rainfall records on the 20th and 21st at the Victoria Regional Airport.  The rainfall also pushed monthly rainfall totals over the all time November record and also pushed the 2004 yearly total over the all time yearly record.The following are observed totals from cooperative and volunteer NWS observers as well as the Victoria Regional ASOS during this episode, occuring from the late afternoon on Nov 20th through the morning of Nov 21st:Weesatche 3 mi S:  12.69""Victoria Regional ASOS:  9.32""Victoria Tanglewood Subdivision:  8.85""Inez 8 mi WNW:  5.81""Victoria Fire Dept:  6.75""Coleto Creek Reservoir:  4.08""Goliad:  1.19""","A NWS survey concluded an HP supercell produced a tornado in the Hidden Valley subdivision, just west of Docasta and approximately 6 miles southeast of Victoria.

One brief tornado was documented, and there were numerous reports of large hail and damaging, straight-line, downburst, thunderstorm winds.  Most of the larger hailstones consisted of clumps of soft hail of various sizes.  The responsible surface low-pressure system developed in the Plains during the morning hours, and moved to northwest Wisconsin by the late evening hours.  Meanwhile, an associated surface warm front surged north into central Wisconsin during the morning hours, bringing unseasonably warm air into the area.  Maximum afternoon temperatures ranged from the upper 60s to mid 70s inland from Lake Michigan, with the highest reading of 77 in Janesville and 9NW Beloit.As instability increased during the morning, isolated thunderstorms developed across eastern part of the state of Iowa.  These storms grew more intense and moved into south-central and southwest Wisconsin.  The first round of severe thunderstorms occurred as an elongated supercell crossed the Illinois/Wisconsin border and into Lafayette and Iowa counties between 1130 and 1220CST.  This storm produced .75 to 1.50 inch diameter hail before moving into Dane county where it split into two supercells.  The northern most supercell briefly produced an F0 tornado just east of Waunakee.  Both of these storms continued through Columbia, Dodge, and Fond du Lac counties where they produced funnel clouds, wind gusts to 56 knots (65 mph), and .75 to 1.25 inch diameter hail.  As clouds began to decrease in the wake of these supercells, instability increased and scattered thunderstorms re-developed across south-central and southeast Wisconsin during the afternoon.  These storms quickly pulsed to severe limits, producing wind gusts generally between 52 and 60 knots (60 to 70 mph) and 3/4 to 1 inch diameter hail.  One thunderstorm's gust front produced a gustnado just northwest of St. Lawrence (Washington Co.) with estimated wind gusts to 65 knots (75 mph).The final round of severe thunderstorms (just ahead of a cold front) developed across northeast Illinois and pushed through southeast Wisconsin between 1700 and 1900CST.  These storms produced 3/4 to 1 inch diameter hail, and wind gusts to around 52 knots (60 mph) across portions of Milwaukee, Waukesha, Walworth, Racine, and Kenosha counties.  The damaging winds blew over a billboard in Kenosha county and parts of a roof and power lines were found on a roadway in Racine county.","A weak F0 tornado spun up east of Waunakee on a seed farm on the north side of State Highway 19.  It slightly damaged the corner overhang of a storage shed, blew a wagon and plastic crates into a field, and rotated a heavy forklift while the operator was sitting in it.  The winds were estimated at 56 to 61 knots (65 to 70 mph).",PDS

In addition, a narrow corridor of spotty and more intense damage to homes, trees and buildings suggested that a tornado had struck near 9:50 pm on Balderstadt Road about 1 mile northwest of Littig. The conclusion was supported by the fact that debris in a small confined area of homes as well as mobile homes and outbuildings was scattered in all four cardinal directions, indicating it could not have been part of a downburst. The path length in this touchdown would have been less than a quarter mile.  The damage was rated F0.From that point eastward, through the community of Littig to near Elgin, the damage was general widespread and had been laid down in a single direction toward the east.  This was the same direction in which the supercell storm was moving.  However, damage in the east part of Littig was again concentrated with the debris laid down in many different directions.  Many of the Littig residents reported that the high winds struck and then was followed by the ""sound of a freight train.""  One resident reported that his ears popped just in advance of the worst damage.  These reports, along with the shape and nature of damage indicated that part of the damage in the east section of Littig was due to a second touchdown of the same tornado. This location would be about 1 mile east of the first touchdown.  The time of the strike is estimated as 2156 CST. The tornado continued on the ground for approximately one half mile where it struck a mobile home along its side, rolled it into a second mobile home, destroying the first mobile home.  Evidence showed that the first mobile home had actually been tied down with straps, but that the straps had not prevented it being moved.  The straps were still in place and anchored in spite of the fact that the mobile home was gone.  Remnants of the first mobile home appear to have prevented major damage to the second mobile home.  This damage was rated as F1.  In all, it was miraculous that so many large pieces of tin, wood and metal had been ripped from homes and structures and thrown around the area, driven into the ground, wrapped around trees and poles, and yet not a single injury.",PDS

It appears the tornado began at 614 AM CDT. There was F0 damage,in the form of scattered tree damage, from Vine Road just south of the Clay County line, east to near Highway 49.The damage increased to F1 damage along Highway 49, especially to the southeast of the highway. There were several dozen trees snapped and uprooted, with many signs of convergence in the pattern of fallen trees. There were a few broken windows in two houses, and one house had its carport lifted up off most of its supportcolumns. In the same area of concentrated damage, four chicken houses sustained significant roof damage, and thetin was blown down the tornado track for about 100 yards. The chicken houses were just north of the county line,in Clay County. The tornado damage path was about 200 yards wide at this point. This damage occurred around 618 AMCDT. The tornado path continued to the east with more trees blown down along the Tallapoosa-Clay county line, including across Simpson Road and County Road 79. As it crossed County Road 79, around 627 AM CDT, the damage wasalong the Tallapoosa-Randolph county line. The damage path entered extreme northwest Chambers County, around 630 AM,along and north of Highway 22. At this point the tornado track ran parallel to Highway 22 all the way to Wadley,on a northeast track. Three brick buildings were significantly damaged in downtown Wadley, about 100 yards north of the Highway 22/77 intersection, on the east side of Highway 77. The southern most building, built in 1925, sustained a fire several years ago and was condemned. The fire had gutted the two-story building, and only the four walls were left standing. There was no roof on this building and it was taller than the two adjacent and attached buildings. The tornado significantly damaged at least two of the walls, and the top of the building toppled over onto the adjacent buildings, causing more damage. Since the integrity of the building had alreadybeen compromised, it was determined the damage was consistent with F0/F1 wind speeds. The tornado continued northeast across the Tallapoosa River and knocked down more trees near the intersection of County Road 33 and County Road 828, near Louina. The total damage path of the tornado was 17.1 miles long and 200 yards wideat its widest point.

A unseasonably deep upper low had formed aloft over the southwest U.S., while at the same time a cold front dropped south across the state during the day.  Behind the cold front was a strong polar high pressure area. The southwest flow aloft impinged on the frontal boundary, setting the stage for very strong thunderstorm development.  Temperatures reached the low 90s over far southwest Iowa, with mid 80s over the central sections.  Dew points reached the mid 60s to the south of the front by late afternoon.  North of the front, temperatures were in the 50s during the afternoon.  The very unstable air was lifted north over the frontal boundary with explosive development during the early evening as the low level jet began to strengthen.  The airmass to the south was very unstable with lifted indices of -11 C., CAPE values of 3500 J/kg, and a freezing level of only 13,300 feet.  Hail was very widespread with the event.  During the initial convection, a super-cell moved into southwest Iowa.  This storm dropped three small tornadoes in Audubon County.  All of the tornadoes were relatively short lived and caused little damage as they were in open areas.  The main weather feature was the hail.  There were numerous reports of nickel to quarter size hail with the storms.  Th largest hail occurred with the super cell in Audubon County, with tennis ball size hail falling southwest of Audubon.  In several reports of hail of ping pong to golf ball size were received from Carroll and Guthrie Counties.  As the evening progressed, a secondary line of storms formed to the north of the developing MCS.  These formed in an east to west line across northern Iowa, producing a round of hail there.  Late in the storm life cycle, a few of the storms began to produce strong winds.  As one of the storms moved through the Des Moines area, winds of 57 MPH were measured.  Some minor damage occurred to a fast food sign.  Sixty MPH winds were reported in Marion County, while 60 to 65 MPH winds blew down power line poles in Poweshiek County.  Late in the event, as the storms moved through Hamilton County, lightening struck a storage and repair shop building in Webster City.  The building was set ablaze and was a total loss.",Tornado tracked through open fields.,PDS

Although numerous severe thunderstorms occurred, there were two long lasting supercell thunderstorms that moved across portions of West Central Texas. One storm developed over Mitchell County. The storm then split and the south moving storm moved across northeast Sterling County, western Coke County, eastern Tom Green County and into Menard County. This storm produced several tornadoes along its path along with numerous hail reports greater that golf ball size throughout its lifetime. Another supercell developed over Knox County then moved south across Haskell, Jones and Taylor counties before dissipating in central Taylor County. Although no tornadoes were reported with this storm, a few funnel clouds were spotted just to the north of Abilene and near Dyess Airforce Base. This storm also produced very large hail greater than golf balls along its entire path. A bow echo also moved across Haskell and Throckmorton Counties producing 60 to 70 mph winds. Also of note, the town of Robert Lee was struck three times by severe thunderstorms. The last severe thunderstorm produced softball size hail and winds to 87 mph.

A cold front sank southeast into the state during the afternoon and evening hours.  The freezing level was very high, ranging from 15,500 to 17,000 feet across the area.  The lifted indices were in the -8 range by late afternoon.  There was considerable cloud debris over the northern part of the CWA, however clearing set in across the south.  Temperatures soared into the mid 90s with dew point readings in the low to mid 70s.  Plenty of CAPE was available with values by late afternoon in the 3500 to 4000 J/kg range.  Thunderstorms fired along the front and became severe.  The storms did not remain severe for very long as in spite of the linear presentation on radar, the storms became multi-cellular.  The cloud shield and outflow from the storms diminished their intensity within 90 minutes of the storms becoming severe.  During the early stages of the line, a tornado dropped down into Kossuth County south of Algona.  The tornado tracked across a corn field and hit a two year old shed.  The shed was 60 X 90 feet and was damaged significantly.  The farmhouse was damaged with siding pulled off of it, however it was not directly struck.  There were numerous reports of high winds of 60 up to 75 MPH across the west central into the north central counties.  Numerous trees were damaged or toppled and some crop damage was reported.  One of the stronger storms produced winds high enough to topple 3 power poles north of Aspinwall in Crawford County.  Hail from the storms was quite limited, though spotty reports of up to dime size hail were received.

A closed upper level low pressure system lifted northeast out of the southwest U.S. and was centered over southeast South Dakota by the evening of the 13th.  A strong mid level jet of 80 kts was present at 500 Mb.  The atmosphere was unstable, but not as much as it could have been.  Surface temperatures reached the low 80s with dew point readings in the 60s for the most part.  CAPE values measured shortly before thunderstorm initiation were in the 1200 to 1500 J/kg range with lifted indices in the -4 to -7 C. range.  With the upper low moving into the area, cooling took place in the mid and upper levels of the atmosphere during the day with the freezing level dropping to under 11,000 feet over western Iowa.  The freezing level was around 12,500 over the eastern counties.  Lapse rates were around 8 C. in the 850 to 700 mb layer.  Thunderstorms formed over eastern Nebraska by the late afternoon hours.  They formed along the west edge of the dry slot, then lifted northeast across the CWA.  Although the expectation of tornadoes was there, the lifted condensation level was fairly high and limited the number of tornadoes.  Three did touch down in Marion County during the evening hours.  Two of them were in the Melcher area and touched down briefly in farm fields around town.  A third tornado touched down northeast of Knoxville in a field.  Little damage was reported.   Earlier there was another brief touchdown in open country east of Bedford in Taylor County.  The main severe weather mode with the storms was hail.  There were numerous reports of hail in the three quarter to one inch range all along the line.  One of the stronger storms dropped one and one half inch diameter hail in Polk County at Johnston.  A few of the storms produced high winds with scattered damage reported.   semi tractor-trailer truck was blown over east of Arcadia in Carroll County along U.S. Highway 30.",Tornado made a brief touchdown in open areas northeast of Knoxville.,PDS

A large area of high pressure aloft was located over the west half of the country, placing Iowa in a large scale northwest flow pattern.  A weak cold front dropped southeast through the Dakotas and approached northwest Iowa.  At the same time, a series of MCS's developed over the Rockies, and rode around the upper level ridge of high pressure.  During the day, the dew points across Iowa warmed into the mid 60s to mid 70s with surface temperatures in the mid to upper 80s.  The lifted index by evening was in the -5 C. range with CAPE values in the 2000 to 3000 J/kg range.  The provided a rich environment for an MCS that approached the state during the later part of the afternoon.  The MCS developed over eastern Wyoming and southwest South Dakota earlier in the day.  As it overtopped the upper ridge, it turned southeast into Iowa.  As it did, the storms took on more of a bow echo appearance and the cluster became a small Derecho.  Early on in the event a tornado touched down briefly in Emmet County north of Gruver.  It was in open fields and caused little damage.  The main mode of severe weather was in the form of high winds.  There were  few hail reports, however with the freezing level above 16,500 feet, hail was limited.  The winds caused widespread damage from Emmet County, east to Winnebago County, then south into the central part of the state about as far south as Interstate 80.  South of this area no damage was reported as the storms weakened rapidly.  Two semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned in Story County by the high wind about 2 miles west of Nevada.  There was one injury from this.  One of the drivers had to be rescued as he hung over the edge of a bridge.  He was taken to hospital, treated, and released.  There were numerous reports of tree and power line damage over the northwest, north central, and central counties of the state.  High winds blew windows out of a home at the ISU Agronomy Farm.  Structural damage was reported in Marshall County at State Center.  The roof of a large building with a roof of less than two years of age received damage.  A high school roof in Story County at Nevada had its roof partially peeled back as well.  In addition to these reports, there were scattered reports of outbuildings and sheds being flattened by the wind.  Visibility during the high winds was occasionally reduced to near zero in blowing dust by the time the storms reached central Iowa.  The gust front from the storms had moved well ahead of the storms themselves, some 10 to 15 miles ahead, with some of the areas receiving severe winds not receiving any rainfall at all.",Tornado touched down briefly in open fields north of Gruver.,PDS

Thunderstorms ravaged a large part of south central Nebraska with hail, high winds, a tornado and catastrophic flooding.During evening and early morning hours, 4 to 12 inches of fell from Dawson County east to York County. At Kenesaw and Wood River, over 11 inches of rain was measured. The city of Grand Island set a rainfall record for a single event with 7.21 inches of rain. Statically, this event was a 100 year rain and flood event for the area. 	In Wood River, 12 people were evacuated due to rising water. It was estimated every structure in Wood River sustained some sort of storm damage and wave after wave of severe thunderstorms pounded the town. Twelve homes sustained severe damage. The Wood River crested at 9 feet in town and flooding most streets.  Thirty-six homes were evacuated in the city of Grand Island as flooding was rampant over the west and north part of the city. The city's sewer system handled about 75 million gallons of water, or about 6 times the normal amount during the storm. Many parts of the business and residential districts sustained flood damage as the Prairie, Silver and Moores Creeks flooded. The Wood River near Alda, which had been dry for three years, tied a record with a crest of 12.2 feet early on the 12th. Elsewhere, three miles of roads were washed out in Kearney County and 15 miles of roads were damaged in Merrick County. Ten bridges were damaged in Merrick County as well. In York County, emergency rescues, one by helicopter and one by air boat, were made to retrieve stranded people trapped by flood waters southeast of Waco and near McCool Junction. Water was over Highway 81 north of Fairmont at the height of the event. In Fillmore and York counties, 5 to 8 inches of rain fell. Further west, a section of Highway 40 was washed out near Miller. Flood damage was in the tens of millions of dollars, with 12 to 15 million dollars in damage in Hall County alone. 	As flooding rains soaked the region, large hail, high winds and one tornado pounded the area. Hastings was particularly hard hit as baseball size hail and high winds belted the city for about 20 minutes. Literally, thousands of vehicles and homes sustained damage, especially on the east side of town, including downtown. Damage was estimated at 40 million, and that may be conservative and insurance agencies processed claims. State Farm Insurance was expecting to process 3,000 claims alone. Thirty-three people left their homes for shelter provided by the city. In Wood River, a tornado clipped the south side of town. In Merrick County, two Union Pacific trains derailed due to high winds and a tower for KMMJ radio was blown down north of town. A communications tower was also destroyed in Buffalo County by high winds. There were widespread, though brief, power outages in the area. At one point, about 60 percent of the city of Lexington was without power. Twelve center pivot irrigation systems were damaged in Fillmore County. High winds destroyed a barn southeast of Gothenburg and grain binds south of Darr in Dawson County. Officials estimate, 2800 homes and businesses had damaged in Grand Island. Both Hall and Adams Counties were declared Federal Disasters Areas.",A brief tornado hit a house on the south side of Wood River.,PDS

The thunderstorms moved northeast of the area by afternoon with a large area of subsidence moving into Iowa.  This allowed the atmosphere to recover during the afternoon.  An upper level closed low pressure area was positioned over western and central Nebraska during the afternoon and evening hours.  The low lifted northeast as a surface dry line extending south from the low advanced east across Kansas.  The airmass was quite unstable with lifted indices around -8 C. by late afternoon and mixed layer CAPE values in the 3000 to 4000 J/kg range.  The freezing level at the beginning of the event was around 14,000 feet.  Thunderstorms became tornadic to the southwest of Iowa during the late afternoon.  One of the storms produced a tornado in northern Missouri which crossed into Ringgold County.  The tornado passed through farm fields for about a mile before lifting.  Little damage resulted.  The storms moved in to south central Iowa and produced some very large hail.  Softball size hail fell during the early stages of the event in Ringgold County, with baseball size hail in Decatur County.  As the system moved northeast, hail sizes decreased and the event turned into more of a wind event.   There were several reports of 55 to 65 MPH winds received as the line lifted northeast.  Some damage occurred, however the damage was not widespread.","Tornado crossed into Iowa from Harrision County, MO and passed across a few farm fields before lifting.",PDS

Although no injuries resulted, the hail caused nearly a million dollars worth of damage to homes, businesses, and vehicles throughout the city.Storm spotters observed two tornadoes as the evolving high precipitation supercell tracked over rural areas of eastern Eddy County. The tornadoes were short-lived and remained over open range land near New Mexico State Highway 128.The supercell storm eventually dissipated as it approached Eunice in eastern Lea County during the late evening hours. Hail up to the size of half dollars was reported as the storm weakened just west of the city.","A Skywarn Spotter observed the first of two tornadoes in eastern Eddy County. The tornado was described as being ""fairly wide"" and was located in open range land near New Mexico State Highway 128. No damage resulted from the tornado.",PDS

In collaboration with the Center for Severe Weather Research in Boulder, CO and Texas Tech University meteorologists assessing the tornadoes across the county with Doppler-On-Wheels (DOW) data, a better understanding of the wind fields and tornado timing was achieved.  The area of assessed damage was bounded by a triangle comprised of FM2320 to the south, FM1228 to the east, and CR112 to the west.  There was a damage path characterized by tree damage across the zone.  The path of the damage was oriented from a northeast-east to southwest-west direction.  DOW data confirmed the large, wedge tornado initially propagated to the east and northeast, became nearly stationary, then rotate southward around the west side of the parent mesocyclone.  The tornado moved to the southwest, then south and crossed FM1228 from the north/northeast to the south/southwest.  The path of the tornado was between 0.6 to 0.7 miles wide.  In assessing the damage, a circulatory patter was evident in a wheat field owned by a private farmer, with all of the wheat laying down to the south.  Along this quadrant of the circulation, large farm equipment (tractors and cotton trailers) were tossed and mangled.  An 80,000 lb box car was shaken by the tornado and the associated strong wind but was not moved from its location, however the contents inside were disturbed.  The farm vehicles were tossed briefly a few times as there were scar marks and impact marks in the field as the equipment was blown to the south.  The front-end of one tractor was snapped off after the second impact with the ground, as the vehicle was likely too heavy to remain airborne and was dragged and rolled by the tornadic wind and circulation.  On the east side of the circulation, there were tree branches not grown in that immediate area that were stripped clean of bark.  A cotton trailer (lighter than the other equipment) was lifted from its original location and was tossed to the north and mangled upon impact.  The equipment was tossed approximately 3/10 of a mile within the circulation.  It was evident from the damage pattern and debris, the circulation was multi-vortex in nature.  The DOW measured wind speeds ranging from 45, 65 and 90 meters per second at various stages of the tornado life cycle at heights between 3 and 50 meters above ground level.",PDS

One pulsing storm produced damaging downburst winds which toppled large trees on a golf course southeast of Monroe.  One strong supercell storm crossed into Wisconsin and propagated into Rock County where it nearly stalled and began backbuilding.  Rotating wall clouds were reported across Rock County by law enforcement.  Golf ball sized hail (1.75"") was reported from 1 NE Milton to 7 NE Milton at 1500CST, resulting in extensive crop damage.  Downburst winds were reported west, north, and northeast of Milton.  At 1507CST a rain-wrapped tornado developed 4 NNE Milton and traveled east to 5 NE Milton where it dissipated at 1511CST.  Some structural damage resulted, and winds were estimated around 85 knots (100 mph), giving this tornado a F1 ranking.  Other thunderstorms developed across Columbia and Dodge counties, producing mainly funnel clouds.The second round of severe weather came with the cold front after 2100CST.  A line of severe thunderstorms, with some bowing segments, developed and pushed through south central and southeast Wisconsin during the late evening.  Damaging winds, which toppled large trees, with some large hail, were noted with this line.  A thunderstorm with estimated wind gusts of 65 knots (75 mph) caused a tree to be uprooted and land on a house in Baraboo at 2110 CST, causing 20,000 dollars in damage.

A couple trying to outrun the storm in their car said that the funnel suddenly surrounded their vehicle.  The car began to shake and the back end started to lift off the ground while at the same time branches were flying by the car.  At a property nearby the tornado sheared off a garage roof, twisted a swing set up ""like a pretzel"", broke windows, and downed trees. The tornado pushed northeast and crossed Interstate 94 where it was witnessed by several motorists.  Next the twister damaged a farmstead near the intersection of County Highway J and 170th Street about 4 miles southwest of Hammond.  A number of horses were picked up and injured by flying debris. One horse had to be put down because of a severe leg injury. Three sheds (42x80 feet, 27x14 feet, and 150 feet long) were downed. After striking the farmstead the tornado destroyed two barns, a few sheds, and snapped or uprooted many trees before reaching Hammond.  The tornado was at its strongest when it moved into the northwest corner of Hammond where it damaged 24 homes, mainly in the Meadows subdivision. A row of 5 townhouses sustained significant roof and garage damage and one building had to be demolished. The tornado caused grills, lawn furniture, and building debris to be thrown into the exterior walls and windows of homes. Several neighborhood residents took shelter in ground floor bathrooms and closets (the homes did not have basements) and incredibly no one was injured. Twenty seven families had to be sheltered by the Red Cross until the damage to their homes could be repaired. Hammond Golf Course lost 47 mature fairway trees between the 9th and 6th tee box. Three golfers caught outside when the tornado crossed the course had to hang onto trees to survive the forceful winds that threw trees up to 25 feet from where they were ripped from the ground. Just north of town along 90th Avenue the tornado threw a picnic table through the front of a home. The home itself was slightly moved off its foundation and the back wall of the home was ripped off. Two sheds on the property were picked up and dropped back down. This tornado was widely photographed and videotaped.",PDS

Thunderstorms developed along a stationary frontal boundary over the western low rolling plains and the northeastern Permian Basin during the late afternoon. These storms evolved into supercells, and one storm produced a series of tornadoes across southern Borden and northern Howard Counties. By mid evening, a small cluster of organized severe storms evolved and produced more widespread hail, damaging winds, and heavy rainfall. Damages to agricultural interests across the region were significant, and accounted for a majority of the estimated $2.2 million worth of losses reported.","A significant tornado developed in southern Borden County shortly after 18:00 CST. This tornado initially formed just north of Farm to Market Road 1785 three miles west of that highway's intersection with Farm to Market Road 1205. The tornado then slowly moved southwest, and resulted in a wide swath of damage to mesquite trees, road signs, fences, and utility poles as it crossed Farm to Market Road 1785.The tornado's damaging ground circulation briefly dissipated south of Farm to Market Road 1785 in south-central Borden County. Video provided by the public and storm spotters indicated that this phase of the tornado's life cycle was characterized by a condensation funnel that reached half way to the ground with no debris visible near the ground. National Weather Service meteorologists that conducted a damage survey of the tornado's track initially concluded that the broken damage path was likely the result of two separate tornadoes. Photographic evidence, however, supports that the funnel aloft remained well-defined and that the tornado reformed about one mile north of the Borden and Howard County line. The tornado crossed a county road near the Howard County line, and left a three-quarter mile wide swath of damage to mesquite trees and fences. Large drifts of wind blown mud accumulated several feet high along barbed-wire fences on the north side of the tornadoes circulation. A tin shed also was severely damaged. The tornado then moved over plowed fields as it crossed into north-central Howard County.Damage in the Borden County segment of the tornado's path would suggest a weak category rating. This may be largely due to a lack of man made structures that were affected. More significant (F2) damage was observed along the Howard County segment of the damage path. The total path length over Borden and Howard Counties was nine miles.",PDS

During the previous day, a strong short wave moved across Minnesota into Wisconsin.  A trailing frontal boundary swept across Iowa and set up an east to west boundary across northern Missouri into Kansas.  This boundary resulted in an area of thunderstorms during the night of the 18th into the morning of the 19th.  These storms reinforced the boundary.  During the afternoon of the 19th, the boundary set of another line of thunderstorms in the same area.  In the meantime, another cold frontal boundary moved into northwest Iowa from the northwest during the afternoon and evening of the 19th.  The airmass ahead of the boundary became unstable with surface temperatures warming into the upper 80s to low 90s and dew point readings in the low to mid 70s.  Moisture streamed north into the are as a tropical tap was clearly evident on satellite pictures extending into Iowa.  Precipitable water values reached 1.5 to 2 inches across the area.  By evening, lifted indices were in the -5 to -8 C. range with cape values in the 1500 to 3000 J/kg range.  In spite of the unstable airmass, hail as limited with freezing levels between 15,000 and 15,800 feet.  The storms that developed along the old frontal boudary to the south of Iowa effectively cut off much of the severe weather potential across the CWA.  Some storms did form ahead of the cold front.  They produced 40 to 50 MPH winds and small hail for the most part.  The interesting feature of the air mass over Iowa was the fact that Iowa was in an island of dry air aloft during the day with 850 mb dew points in the zero to +5 C. range.  This aided in the development of numerous non-severe downburst wind events.  During the evening, a strong moisture gradient lifted north into the state.  The moisture gradient created a boundary and helped produce the conditions for one of the thunderstorms to produce a brief tornado touchdown in Tama County.  The tornado touched down in open country and caused little damage.  Storms earlier in Story County produced downburst winds that downed power poles in Story County at Nevada and damaged branches in the town of Gilbert.",Tornado touched down briefly in farm fields south of Garwin.,PDS

Emily then went on to become a hurricane at 10 pm July 13th and then proceeded to become a Category 3 storm at 4 pm July 14th in the Caribbean Sea. Emily then reached Category 4 strength at 1 am CDT July 15th and made landfall along the Yucatan peninsula during the early morning of July 18th. Emily re-emerged off the Yucatan peninsula and regained category 3 strength in the Southwestern Gulf of Mexico at 6 pm CDT July 19th. Emily then proceeded to make landfall along the northeast coast of Mexico early in the morning on July 20th 2005.Emily produced heavy rains over south Texas with storm total rainfall amounts generally ranging between 1.5 and 5 inches.  Storm tides (including astronomical tide, storm surge, and wind-driven waves) caused minor to moderate flooding along the lower Texas coast from the port mansfield jetties southward to the Rio Grande.Sea water washed over the State Road 100, approximately 4 to 6 miles north of the South Padre Island City limits, where only the beach and natural sand dunes exist. The building of additional burms along the beaches and dunes did prevent much of the sea water from flooding within the City of South Padre Island.Only minimal and isolated damage was reported from local law enforcement agencies and county emergency operation centers.  Damage consisted of isolated structural damage to buildings from tropical storm force winds.  Several trees were uprooted or damaged and were consistent with the reported observed wind speeds.  Emily produced five confirmed tornadoes over Deep South Texas, and isolated flash flooding, primarily over Hidalgo County.",Short-lived tornado was reported by the general public.

Sixteen tornadoes were documented on this day in south-central and southeast Wisconsin, a new single-day record.  A line of supercells developed and pushed across south-central Wisconsin during the afternoon hours, and then pushed east across southeast Wisconsin during the evening hours.   Most of the tornadoes were associated with two supercells.  One main supercell tracked across Sauk County and then into Columbia, producing one F0 and one F2 tornado.

It continued east-southeast to the southern edge of Lake Kegonsa and tore through residential neighborhoods about 1/3 to 1/2 mile north of CTH B (Civil Towns of Dunn and Pleasant Springs, and far-northern Stoughton).

One person was crushed to death in their basement from fireplace and chimney bricks that crashed through the floor.  Twenty-three (23) other people were directly injured.  In addition, Emergency Management officials received reports of 2 other indirectly-related deaths associated with this strong tornado.  In these two cases, the people were already very ill or suffering from a life-ending  disease.  Injuries they received during the tornado contributed (secondary) to their death, but were not the primary cause of death, based on medical examiner reports.  Consequently, these additional two deaths do not appear in the official death tally in the header strip of this event.  Numerous homes, businesses, farm buildings, vehicles, power-lines, trees, and other personal effects were either damaged or destroyed along its path that grew to a maximum width of about 600 yards north of Stoughton.  As for residential structures, 220 sustained minor damage, 84 had major damage, and 69 were destroyed.  As for business structures, 6 sustained minor damage, 1 had major damage, and 1 was destroyed.  As for agricultural structures, 5 sustained minor damage, 5 had major damage, and 40 were destroyed.  Total estimated damage amounts (directly-related) for private and public sectors combined was $35.06 M, broken down to $34.31 M in property damage and $750 K in crop losses, for the tornado segment in Dane County.  This tornado was probably the 3rd most costly tornado in Wisconsin's recorded history (1996 Oakfield tornado and 1984 Barneveld tornadoes were more costly). The $34.31 M in property damage was broken down to private losses (total of 32.29 M) and public losses (total of $2.02 M), per Emergency Manager reports and NWS estimates.  The private losses included a total of $25.45 M for residential structures, $1.29 M for businesses, $4.25 M for agricultural structures, $1.00 M for damage to vehicles, boats, and other personal effects, $200 K to agricultural machinery and tools, and $96 K in public road system damage.  The public losses making up part of the $34.31 M consisted of $2.02 M in damage to public utility systems.  The $750 K in damage attributed to crop losses occurred on an estimated 1,550 acres of land.  Additional monetary costs incurred in the public sector (totaling $1.84 M) which are considered indirectly-related damage expenses, and not included in the ""direct"" totals listed in the header-strip of this event, include: $1.38 M in debris clearance, $308 K in protective measures, and miscellaneous damage/expenses of $144 K.  Therefore, the grand total of direct and indirect damage amounts and expenses attributed to this tornado segment in Dane county totaled about $36.89 M.Just south of the tornado, extending out another mile or so, tree and power-line damage resulted from rear-flank downdraft damage - in some cases south to STH 51.

Debris from this tornado was lofted by the parent's updraft and carried downstream to scattered locations in the counties of Jefferson, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Walworth, Racine, and Kenosha.  This tornado was extensively photographed and video-taped by storm spotters (amateur radio operators, etc.), storm chasers, and private citizens.  On occasions, this tornado displayed multiple-vortex characteristics.  Due to partial back-building (to the west-southwest) of the supercell's updraft tower, this tornado moved slowly, and was described by some eyewitnesses and spotters as being nearly stationary at times north of Stoughton.  The overall slow movement (supercell moved at 12-17 knots, or 10-15 mph), coupled with structures that were not thoroughly reinforced (based on NWS damage survey), allowed the tornado's cyclonic winds to more severely damage buildings in its path.  Consequently, although some of the worst damage resembled what would be left by a F4 tornado for well-built homes, this tornado was rated at the top of the F3 category with estimated winds near 174 knots (200 mph).  The F3 category has estimated wind speeds of 137-179 knots (158-206 mph).  A sampling of newspaper headlines and personal quotes included: ""The Sky Just Exploded,""  ""Hard to Believe There Weren't More Deaths,"" ""New Technology Lowers Tornado Deaths,""  ""Counting Losses, Blessings,"" ""It Was Probably The Most Intense Storm In The Country This Year,"" ""It's a Mess Out Here,"" and ""I've Never Experienced Anything Like This.""  The tornado cut electrical power for 1700 customers in the Stoughton area.  The estimated average path length was about 175 yards.",PDS

Additional indirect costs totaled almost $1.9 M, resulting in a total direct and direct cost of about $38.5 M. Synoptically, a surface low pressure system was located over extreme southeast Minnesota early in the afternoon.  A warm front extended east southeast from the low with dew points pooling in the lower 70s along it.  The surface low moved east into east central Wisconsin by 2100CST that evening.  Favorable wind shear associated with the warm front, combined with the strong instability supplied by the heat and humidity, helped to produce numerous tornadic supercells.","This tornado briefly spun up and dissipated at 1555CST about 2.5 miles east-northeast of Avoca, or about 0.6 mile west-northwest of the intersection of STH 130 and Leaches Crossing Road.  Only some tree damage was noted on a storm survey.  This tornado was rated a F0 with estimated wind speeds of 35-63 knots (40-72 mph).",PDS

Emily then went on to become a hurricane at 10 pm July 13th and then proceeded to become a Category 3 storm at 4 pm July 14th in the Caribbean Sea. Emily then reached Category 4 strength at 1 am CDT July 15th and made landfall along the Yucatan peninsula during the early morning of July 18th. Emily re-emerged off the Yucatan peninsula and regained category 3 strength in the Southwestern Gulf of Mexico at 6 pm CDT July 19th. Emily then proceeded to make landfall along the northeast coast of Mexico early in the morning on July 20th 2005.Emily produced heavy rains over south Texas with storm total rainfall amounts generally ranging between 1.5 and 5 inches.  Storm tides (including astronomical tide, storm surge, and wind-driven waves) caused minor to moderate flooding along the lower Texas coast from the port mansfield jetties southward to the Rio Grande.Sea water washed over the State Road 100, approximately 4 to 6 miles north of the South Padre Island City limits, where only the beach and natural sand dunes exist. The building of additional burms along the beaches and dunes did prevent much of the sea water from flooding within the City of South Padre Island.Only minimal and isolated damage was reported from local law enforcement agencies and county emergency operation centers.  Damage consisted of isolated structural damage to buildings from tropical storm force winds.  Several trees were uprooted or damaged and were consistent with the reported observed wind speeds.  Emily produced five confirmed tornadoes over Deep South Texas, and isolated flash flooding, primarily over Hidalgo County.",Tornado was reported by local media in south McAllen.

Cooler and drier air was to the north of the front, with very warm and unstable air to the south.  Dew point temperatures approached 70 to the south of the boundary during the morning hours of the 8th.  A short wave tracked southeast across the area in a general northwest flow.  The air mass became quite unstable in the vicinity of the boundary with lifted indices around -7 C.  The shear profile was favorable with about 40 kts of shear in the lower layers.  Plenty of deep moisture was available with the system with precipitable water values in the 1.5 to 1.8 inch range.  Hail was somewhat limited with the storms, but not absent with freezing levels in the 12,500 to 13,000 foot range.  CAPE values ahead of the storms were in the 1500 to 2000 J/kg range, with CAPE in the -10 C to -30 C layer of the atmosphere in the 400 J/kg range.

An intense cluster of storms moved through the central Iowa area with measured wind gusts of 83 MPH reported at both Ames and Ankeny with the gust front passage.  There was one reported tornado with the system in Ames.  The tornado touched down near the power plant o nthe ISU Campus.  Eight people were injured by the tornado.  One was injured seriously enough to be taken to hospital.  Initial damage estimates were around $150,000.  Many of the storms produced hail, however much of the hail was below severe limits. Reports of penny size hail were received from several locations.   The largest hail came with the cluster in central Iowa.  Golf ball size hail fell west of Elkhart in Polk County.  The storm and high winds resulted in power outages to 8700 customers in the Des Moines area.  The high winds caused a semi-tractortrailer and a camper to oberturn on INterstate 80 just west of exit 141 in Polk County.  The thunderstorms also produced locally heavy rainfall.

A strong upper level system moved through the area with mid and upper level winds in the 70 to 90 kt range.  Low level winds of 35 to 50 kts transported moisture north into the system.  High temperatures reached the mid 60s to low 70s, with dew point readings approaching 60 by late afternoon.  A surface low developed over northern Kansas during the previous night and lifted northeast into eastern South Dakota during the afternoon of the 12th, then into central Minnesota as a 985 mb low by late evening.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with CAPE values reaching 1000 J/kg by late afternoon.  The Lifted Index values were in the -5 C. range.  Being as it was in November, the freezing level was quite low during the event, in the 10,000 to 11,000 foot range.  Though the soundings were quite unidirectional, there was plenty of shear with zero to 6 km shear values around 65 kts. Thunderstorms erupted during the afternoon in west central in to southwest Iowa.  The storms became severe quite quickly.  Initially the storms produce quarter to golf ball size hail, with 2 1/2 inch diameter hail falling in Dallas County.  Hail up to baseball size fell in Greene County as well.  The system transitioned into a tornadic system within an hour with several tornadoes touching down in the central sections of the state.  At least 9 communities were hit by tornadoes and 65 homes damaged or destroyed.  An 82 year old woman was killed in Stratford when the tornado demolished her home.  In a 2 or 3 block area of downtown Woodward, at least 12 houses were totally destroyed.  There was one minor injury in Ames,  two serious injuries in the Woodward area, and three injuries in Stratford.  Due to the extensive damage to property caused by the tornadoes, Iowa Governor Vilsack declared Boone, Story, Webster, Dallas and Hamilton Counties disaster areas.A long-lived tornado tracked through several counties across central Iowa during the late afternoon hours of Nov. 12, 2005.  The tornado path is estimated at 27.5 miles long and between 100 and 150 yards wide along the damage path.Tornado (1) initially touched down just west of E Avenue (just south of Boxholm in northwest Boone county), one half mile south of Boone County Highway E18 at approximately 4:27 p.m as an F1 tornado.  The tornado then tracked northeast across E Avenue, hitting a farm just north of E18, damaging the home and some out buildings.  It also flipped over one pickup truck and killed two horses at this location.The tornado continued northeast, spreading debris across F Avenue just north of 125th Street as it maintained F1 intensity.  Two additional homes were damaged with outbuildings destroyed as the tornado tracked northeast across G and H Avenues near 105th Avenue.  It then intensified to an F2 tornado as it crossed the Boone/Webster county line.  Another home was heavily damaged and a large outbuilding destroyed just north of the Boone/Webster county line.  The tornado quickly moved northeast, crossing 390th Street and headed toward the Des Moines River, weakening to an F1 tornado.A continuous, but weak damage path was observed crossing the river as the tornado tracked across open farmland and land adjacent the Des Moines River.  The tornado has been rated an F1 tornado during this time.  After crossing County D64 in Webster county, the tornado struck another farm near 370th Street and Washington Avenue, damaging the residence and destroying a machine shed along with most of its contents.  The tornado again intensified to an F2 at this location.The tornado then headed toward Stratford, crossing the Webster and Hamilton county line just west of County Road D54.  The tornado entered Stratford at 4:46 p.m. on the west-central end of town, heavily damaging many homes.  The tornado crossed the city park and then exited the city near the north-central portion of Stratford.  Numerous homes were heavily damaged with one fatality.As the tornado left Stratford, it continued on a northeast track, lifting and dropping to the ground several times as an F0 and F1 tornado.  It damaged three additional farms northeast of Stratford with the last damaged farm north of 320th Street and west of County Road R21 in Hamilton County.Tornado (2) touched down one mile west of Minburn in Dallas County  according to the aerial survey.  The tornado tracked northeast for about eight miles, producing F0-F1 damage before intensifying near Highway 141.  The tornado produced F2 damage at a farm one mile southwest of Woodward, and continued to produce F2 damage through the south and east portions of Woodward.  The tornado dissipated one mile northeast of Woodward.  Severe houses slid off their foundations in Woodward, and a double-wide home was flipped upside down into the street.  Total path length was 11 miles.Tornado (3) touched down in open fields one mile northwest of Madrid.  It hit a home three miles north of Madrid on Highway 17, producing F1 damage.  One other farm site sustained damage as the tornado moved northeast.  The tornado dissipated after a six mile track.Tornado (4) started just west of Ames near the Highway 30 and Lincoln Way Split, according to the aerial survey.  The tornado produced F1-F2 damage on the northwest fringe of Ames.  It weakened as it moved northeast, before intensifying again and produced F2 damage to a farm site just south of Gilbert.  F1 damage occurred as the tornado crossed highway 69.  The tornado dissipated three miles south of Story City after a 10 mile track.Tornado (5) was a short-lived satellite tornado that was on the ground for 1.6 miles ending at the southwest edge of Story City.  The aerial survey showed very minor damage.Tornado (6) developed one mile west of Roland and tracked across the extreme southeast corner of Hamilton county before entering Hardin county.

A strong upper level system moved through the area with mid and upper level winds in the 70 to 90 kt range.  Low level winds of 35 to 50 kts transported moisture north into the system.  High temperatures reached the mid 60s to low 70s, with dew point readings approaching 60 by late afternoon.  A surface low developed over northern Kansas during the previous night and lifted northeast into eastern South Dakota during the afternoon of the 12th, then into central Minnesota as a 985 mb low by late evening.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with CAPE values reaching 1000 J/kg by late afternoon.  The Lifted Index values were in the -5 C. range.  Being as it was in November, the freezing level was quite low during the event, in the 10,000 to 11,000 foot range.  Though the soundings were quite unidirectional, there was plenty of shear with zero to 6 km shear values around 65 kts. Thunderstorms erupted during the afternoon in west central in to southwest Iowa.  The storms became severe quite quickly.  Initially the storms produce quarter to golf ball size hail, with 2 1/2 inch diameter hail falling in Dallas County.  Hail up to baseball size fell in Greene County as well.  The system transitioned into a tornadic system within an hour with several tornadoes touching down in the central sections of the state.  At least 9 communities were hit by tornadoes and 65 homes damaged or destroyed.  An 82 year old woman was killed in Stratford when the tornado demolished her home.  In a 2 or 3 block area of downtown Woodward, at least 12 houses were totally destroyed.  There was one minor injury in Ames,  two serious injuries in the Woodward area, and three injuries in Stratford.  Due to the extensive damage to property caused by the tornadoes, Iowa Governor Vilsack declared Boone, Story, Webster, Dallas and Hamilton Counties disaster areas.A long-lived tornado tracked through several counties across central Iowa during the late afternoon hours of Nov. 12, 2005.  The tornado path is estimated at 27.5 miles long and between 100 and 150 yards wide along the damage path.Tornado (1) initially touched down just west of E Avenue (just south of Boxholm in northwest Boone county), one half mile south of Boone County Highway E18 at approximately 4:27 p.m as an F1 tornado.  The tornado then tracked northeast across E Avenue, hitting a farm just north of E18, damaging the home and some out buildings.  It also flipped over one pickup truck and killed two horses at this location.The tornado continued northeast, spreading debris across F Avenue just north of 125th Street as it maintained F1 intensity.  Two additional homes were damaged with outbuildings destroyed as the tornado tracked northeast across G and H Avenues near 105th Avenue.  It then intensified to an F2 tornado as it crossed the Boone/Webster county line.  Another home was heavily damaged and a large outbuilding destroyed just north of the Boone/Webster county line.  The tornado quickly moved northeast, crossing 390th Street and headed toward the Des Moines River, weakening to an F1 tornado.A continuous, but weak damage path was observed crossing the river as the tornado tracked across open farmland and land adjacent the Des Moines River.  The tornado has been rated an F1 tornado during this time.  After crossing County D64 in Webster county, the tornado struck another farm near 370th Street and Washington Avenue, damaging the residence and destroying a machine shed along with most of its contents.  The tornado again intensified to an F2 at this location.The tornado then headed toward Stratford, crossing the Webster and Hamilton county line just west of County Road D54.  The tornado entered Stratford at 4:46 p.m. on the west-central end of town, heavily damaging many homes.  The tornado crossed the city park and then exited the city near the north-central portion of Stratford.  Numerous homes were heavily damaged with one fatality.As the tornado left Stratford, it continued on a northeast track, lifting and dropping to the ground several times as an F0 and F1 tornado.  It damaged three additional farms northeast of Stratford with the last damaged farm north of 320th Street and west of County Road R21 in Hamilton County.Tornado (2) touched down one mile west of Minburn in Dallas County  according to the aerial survey.  The tornado tracked northeast for about eight miles, producing F0-F1 damage before intensifying near Highway 141.  The tornado produced F2 damage at a farm one mile southwest of Woodward, and continued to produce F2 damage through the south and east portions of Woodward.  The tornado dissipated one mile northeast of Woodward.  Severe houses slid off their foundations in Woodward, and a double-wide home was flipped upside down into the street.  Total path length was 11 miles.Tornado (3) touched down in open fields one mile northwest of Madrid.  It hit a home three miles north of Madrid on Highway 17, producing F1 damage.  One other farm site sustained damage as the tornado moved northeast.  The tornado dissipated after a six mile track.Tornado (4) started just west of Ames near the Highway 30 and Lincoln Way Split, according to the aerial survey.  The tornado produced F1-F2 damage on the northwest fringe of Ames.  It weakened as it moved northeast, before intensifying again and produced F2 damage to a farm site just south of Gilbert.

Thunderstorms erupted during the afternoon in west central in to southwest Iowa.  The storms became severe quite quickly.  Initially the storms produce quarter to golf ball size hail, with 2 1/2 inch diameter hail falling in Dallas County.  Hail up to baseball size fell in Greene County as well.  The system transitioned into a tornadic system within an hour with several tornadoes touching down in the central sections of the state.  At least 9 communities were hit by tornadoes and 65 homes damaged or destroyed.  An 82 year old woman was killed in Stratford when the tornado demolished her home.  In a 2 or 3 block area of downtown Woodward, at least 12 houses were totally destroyed.  There was one minor injury in Ames,  two serious injuries in the Woodward area, and three injuries in Stratford.  Due to the extensive damage to property caused by the tornadoes, Iowa Governor Vilsack declared Boone, Story, Webster, Dallas and Hamilton Counties disaster areas.A long-lived tornado tracked through several counties across central Iowa during the late afternoon hours of Nov. 12, 2005.  The tornado path is estimated at 27.5 miles long and between 100 and 150 yards wide along the damage path.Tornado (1) initially touched down just west of E Avenue (just south of Boxholm in northwest Boone county), one half mile south of Boone County Highway E18 at approximately 4:27 p.m as an F1 tornado.  The tornado then tracked northeast across E Avenue, hitting a farm just north of E18, damaging the home and some out buildings.  It also flipped over one pickup truck and killed two horses at this location.The tornado continued northeast, spreading debris across F Avenue just north of 125th Street as it maintained F1 intensity.  Two additional homes were damaged with outbuildings destroyed as the tornado tracked northeast across G and H Avenues near 105th Avenue.  It then intensified to an F2 tornado as it crossed the Boone/Webster county line.  Another home was heavily damaged and a large outbuilding destroyed just north of the Boone/Webster county line.  The tornado quickly moved northeast, crossing 390th Street and headed toward the Des Moines River, weakening to an F1 tornado.A continuous, but weak damage path was observed crossing the river as the tornado tracked across open farmland and land adjacent the Des Moines River.  The tornado has been rated an F1 tornado during this time.  After crossing County D64 in Webster county, the tornado struck another farm near 370th Street and Washington Avenue, damaging the residence and destroying a machine shed along with most of its contents.  The tornado again intensified to an F2 at this location.The tornado then headed toward Stratford, crossing the Webster and Hamilton county line just west of County Road D54.  The tornado entered Stratford at 4:46 p.m. on the west-central end of town, heavily damaging many homes.  The tornado crossed the city park and then exited the city near the north-central portion of Stratford.  Numerous homes were heavily damaged with one fatality.As the tornado left Stratford, it continued on a northeast track, lifting and dropping to the ground several times as an F0 and F1 tornado.  It damaged three additional farms northeast of Stratford with the last damaged farm north of 320th Street and west of County Road R21 in Hamilton County.Tornado (2) touched down one mile west of Minburn in Dallas County  according to the aerial survey.  The tornado tracked northeast for about eight miles, producing F0-F1 damage before intensifying near Highway 141.  The tornado produced F2 damage at a farm one mile southwest of Woodward, and continued to produce F2 damage through the south and east portions of Woodward.  The tornado dissipated one mile northeast of Woodward.  Severe houses slid off their foundations in Woodward, and a double-wide home was flipped upside down into the street.  Total path length was 11 miles.Tornado (3) touched down in open fields one mile northwest of Madrid.  It hit a home three miles north of Madrid on Highway 17, producing F1 damage.  One other farm site sustained damage as the tornado moved northeast.  The tornado dissipated after a six mile track.Tornado (4) started just west of Ames near the Highway 30 and Lincoln Way Split, according to the aerial survey.  The tornado produced F1-F2 damage on the northwest fringe of Ames.  It weakened as it moved northeast, before intensifying again and produced F2 damage to a farm site just south of Gilbert.  F1 damage occurred as the tornado crossed highway 69.  The tornado dissipated three miles south of Story City after a 10 mile track.Tornado (5) was a short-lived satellite tornado that was on the ground for 1.6 miles ending at the southwest edge of Story City.  The aerial survey showed very minor damage.Tornado (6) developed one mile west of Roland and tracked across the extreme southeast corner of Hamilton county before entering Hardin county.  The tornado produced damage up to F1 intensity to rural farm sites in far northern Story county and five miles south of Radcliffe in Hardin county.  The KCCI-TV aerial survey indicated the track was nine miles in length.Tornado (7) was a brief touchdown just south of Williams in Hamilton County.  No damage was found from this brief tornado and it is not shown here.Tornado (8) was briefly sighted near Blakesburg in Monroe County.  The tornado produced minor damage to a farm building but was not surveyed.Tornado (9) touched down briefly north of Steamboat Rock in Hardin County.  The tornado caused little damage.Tornado (10) was actually the first tornado of the day.  It formed from the same supercell that eventually moved northeast into the Stratford area.  The tornado caused little damage as it moved through fields south of the Scranton Area.Tornado (11) was a brief touchdown on the southwest edge of the Ames City limits.  This tornado was from the same parent cell as the previous tornado that touched down in Ames, but was distinct.  The tornado was weak and lifted lawn chairs and caused some shingle damage.  This tornado was ANTICYCLONIC in nature.","Tornado moved from Story County and across southeast Hamilton County, then into Hardin County.",PDS

The tornado then tracked northeast across E Avenue, hitting a farm just north of E18, damaging the home and some out buildings.  It also flipped over one pickup truck and killed two horses at this location.The tornado continued northeast, spreading debris across F Avenue just north of 125th Street as it maintained F1 intensity.  Two additional homes were damaged with outbuildings destroyed as the tornado tracked northeast across G and H Avenues near 105th Avenue.  It then intensified to an F2 tornado as it crossed the Boone/Webster county line.  Another home was heavily damaged and a large outbuilding destroyed just north of the Boone/Webster county line.  The tornado quickly moved northeast, crossing 390th Street and headed toward the Des Moines River, weakening to an F1 tornado.A continuous, but weak damage path was observed crossing the river as the tornado tracked across open farmland and land adjacent the Des Moines River.  The tornado has been rated an F1 tornado during this time.  After crossing County D64 in Webster county, the tornado struck another farm near 370th Street and Washington Avenue, damaging the residence and destroying a machine shed along with most of its contents.

The tornado produced F2 damage at a farm one mile southwest of Woodward, and continued to produce F2 damage through the south and east portions of Woodward.  The tornado dissipated one mile northeast of Woodward.  Severe houses slid off their foundations in Woodward, and a double-wide home was flipped upside down into the street.  Total path length was 11 miles.Tornado (3) touched down in open fields one mile northwest of Madrid.  It hit a home three miles north of Madrid on Highway 17, producing F1 damage.  One other farm site sustained damage as the tornado moved northeast.  The tornado dissipated after a six mile track.Tornado (4) started just west of Ames near the Highway 30 and Lincoln Way Split, according to the aerial survey.  The tornado produced F1-F2 damage on the northwest fringe of Ames.  It weakened as it moved northeast, before intensifying again and produced F2 damage to a farm site just south of Gilbert.  F1 damage occurred as the tornado crossed highway 69.

A strong upper level system moved through the area with mid and upper level winds in the 70 to 90 kt range.  Low level winds of 35 to 50 kts transported moisture north into the system.  High temperatures reached the mid 60s to low 70s, with dew point readings approaching 60 by late afternoon.  A surface low developed over northern Kansas during the previous night and lifted northeast into eastern South Dakota during the afternoon of the 12th, then into central Minnesota as a 985 mb low by late evening.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with CAPE values reaching 1000 J/kg by late afternoon.  The Lifted Index values were in the -5 C. range.  Being as it was in November, the freezing level was quite low during the event, in the 10,000 to 11,000 foot range.  Though the soundings were quite unidirectional, there was plenty of shear with zero to 6 km shear values around 65 kts. Thunderstorms erupted during the afternoon in west central in to southwest Iowa.  The storms became severe quite quickly.  Initially the storms produce quarter to golf ball size hail, with 2 1/2 inch diameter hail falling in Dallas County.  Hail up to baseball size fell in Greene County as well.  The system transitioned into a tornadic system within an hour with several tornadoes touching down in the central sections of the state.  At least 9 communities were hit by tornadoes and 65 homes damaged or destroyed.  An 82 year old woman was killed in Stratford when the tornado demolished her home.  In a 2 or 3 block area of downtown Woodward, at least 12 houses were totally destroyed.  There was one minor injury in Ames,  two serious injuries in the Woodward area, and three injuries in Stratford.  Due to the extensive damage to property caused by the tornadoes, Iowa Governor Vilsack declared Boone, Story, Webster, Dallas and Hamilton Counties disaster areas.A long-lived tornado tracked through several counties across central Iowa during the late afternoon hours of Nov. 12, 2005.  The tornado path is estimated at 27.5 miles long and between 100 and 150 yards wide along the damage path.Tornado (1) initially touched down just west of E Avenue (just south of Boxholm in northwest Boone county), one half mile south of Boone County Highway E18 at approximately 4:27 p.m as an F1 tornado.  The tornado then tracked northeast across E Avenue, hitting a farm just north of E18, damaging the home and some out buildings.  It also flipped over one pickup truck and killed two horses at this location.The tornado continued northeast, spreading debris across F Avenue just north of 125th Street as it maintained F1 intensity.  Two additional homes were damaged with outbuildings destroyed as the tornado tracked northeast across G and H Avenues near 105th Avenue.  It then intensified to an F2 tornado as it crossed the Boone/Webster county line.  Another home was heavily damaged and a large outbuilding destroyed just north of the Boone/Webster county line.  The tornado quickly moved northeast, crossing 390th Street and headed toward the Des Moines River, weakening to an F1 tornado.A continuous, but weak damage path was observed crossing the river as the tornado tracked across open farmland and land adjacent the Des Moines River.  The tornado has been rated an F1 tornado during this time.  After crossing County D64 in Webster county, the tornado struck another farm near 370th Street and Washington Avenue, damaging the residence and destroying a machine shed along with most of its contents.  The tornado again intensified to an F2 at this location.The tornado then headed toward Stratford, crossing the Webster and Hamilton county line just west of County Road D54.  The tornado entered Stratford at 4:46 p.m. on the west-central end of town, heavily damaging many homes.  The tornado crossed the city park and then exited the city near the north-central portion of Stratford.  Numerous homes were heavily damaged with one fatality.As the tornado left Stratford, it continued on a northeast track, lifting and dropping to the ground several times as an F0 and F1 tornado.  It damaged three additional farms northeast of Stratford with the last damaged farm north of 320th Street and west of County Road R21 in Hamilton County.Tornado (2) touched down one mile west of Minburn in Dallas County  according to the aerial survey.  The tornado tracked northeast for about eight miles, producing F0-F1 damage before intensifying near Highway 141.  The tornado produced F2 damage at a farm one mile southwest of Woodward, and continued to produce F2 damage through the south and east portions of Woodward.  The tornado dissipated one mile northeast of Woodward.  Severe houses slid off their foundations in Woodward, and a double-wide home was flipped upside down into the street.  Total path length was 11 miles.Tornado (3) touched down in open fields one mile northwest of Madrid.  It hit a home three miles north of Madrid on Highway 17, producing F1 damage.  One other farm site sustained damage as the tornado moved northeast.  The tornado dissipated after a six mile track.Tornado (4) started just west of Ames near the Highway 30 and Lincoln Way Split, according to the aerial survey.  The tornado produced F1-F2 damage on the northwest fringe of Ames.  It weakened as it moved northeast, before intensifying again and produced F2 damage to a farm site just south of Gilbert.  F1 damage occurred as the tornado crossed highway 69.  The tornado dissipated three miles south of Story City after a 10 mile track.Tornado (5) was a short-lived satellite tornado that was on the ground for 1.6 miles ending at the southwest edge of Story City.

Additional thunderstorms over northern Hidalgo and Starr counties began generating surface outflow boundaries near the original storm northeast of Raymondville. Of interesting note, several large dust devils had been observed by NWS meteorologists in Kenedy and Willacy counties in the early afternoon, suggesting that the surface air was quite unstable and sufficient rotation was available for tornadoes to form. As the outflow boundaries began to converge at Raymondville, the storm began producing severe wind gusts. The tornado moved through Raymondville, Texas at 450 PM CDT, lasting about two minutes, while the entire storm lasted from 445 PM until about 530 PM. The tornado touched down near 6th Street and San Francisco moving southwest along the railroad track and Business 77. The director of emergency management in Raymondville was a witness to the tornado and relayed the report to the police department. The tornado dissipated at the southern end of town and appears to have been the only tornado to form out of this storm. Spotter reports and damage survey crews noted isolated damage along the path with several trees and buildings sustaining minor damage. Rail gate crossings were twisted and broken apart along with several utility poles that were snapped apart several feet above the ground. Another tornado was reported just west of Combes, Texas.  That tornado was short-lived and did not produce any damage.  Elsewhere, reports of funnel clouds and a tornado were also received in Harlingen, Texas south of Raymondville. The tornado touched down in open farm land spinning up dust and some debris however no damage was reported with this twister.Additional storms generated severe winds around McCook, TX where minor damage was sustained to barns and smaller structures. Several reports of broken trees (6-8 inches in diameter) were also noted. At the intersection of M Road and Schunior, in Edinburg, TX, a series of high tension power poles were snapped of 10 to 12 feet above the ground. Oddly, no other structures in the vicinity sustained damage and it appears that the damage was caused by straight line severe thunderstorm wind gusts.Incidentally, several days prior to these severe thunderstorms, the Rio Grande Valley and northeast Mexico (state of Tamaulipas) had experienced record maximum temperatures ranging from 104 to 106 degrees Fahrenheit, due in large part to atmospheric subsidence caused by the effects of Hurricane Katrina.",,PDS

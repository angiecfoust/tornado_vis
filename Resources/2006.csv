This was due to a combination of both severe thunderstorm winds and a strong tornado.  The wind damage, which had ended just south of Uvalde, once again was observed beginning just west of the Agape area by the team.  The damage continued toward the east nearly one quarter mile to the Agape compound.  Roof damage was noted at the first buildings, along with widespread damage to trees.  Continuing to the east, the team found a mobile home that had been completely destroyed with the debris deposited about 30 yards to the south.  This was the first time damage had been thrown in any direction except to the east and is believed to be just east of the starting point of the tornado.  About 50 yards further to the east, an asphalt road was observed to have chunks of the topping removed and tossed toward the southeast. Very nearby, a large three-story concrete and steel-beam gymnasium valued at one million dollars had been gutted by the storm.  The windward, west side was not blown inward as would have occurred with severe thunderstorm winds.  Instead, it was pulled outward.  A 40-foot steel beam had been bolted in a dozen different places to the building.  The beam was pulled from the building and thrown back 15 feet to the northwest.  Although many of the supporting steel beams held, several were pulled away and tossed.  Concrete blocks, filled solid with concrete in their construction, had been ripped out of the building and lay tossed and strewn over the area.  Much of the wall structure was destroyed.  Pieces of sheet metal were strewn to the east and southeast for nearly one half mile.  Additional damage to vegetation stretched for another 2 miles east of the gymnasium.  Some of this damage was clearly due to severe thunderstorm winds and some of the damage was due to the tornado.  Based on the level of damage of the mobile home and the gymnasium, the tornado was rated F2.  The path width was estimated at 50 yards and the path length was estimated at 2 miles.  From the reports available, it is thought the tornado developed about 1020 pm CST and dissipated around 1025 pm CST.  It is the strongest tornado in South Central Texas since the evening of October 12, 2001, when an F3 tornado struck Stonewall, and an F2 tornado struck Hondo.",PDS

At the car dealership, about 50 cars were damaged by wind-blown debris and hail, with windows broken. At a mobile home dealership, an unsecured mobile home trailer was turned on its side and pushed next to another trailer.

Moisture was somewhat limited with a narrow band of one to one and one quarter inch precipitable water values lifting northeast into the state.  Temperatures warmed into the low 80s during the afternoon, but convection was hindered in most areas with dew points in the 30s to low 40s.  A narrow band of dew points in the upper 50s to low 60s pushed into southwest Iowa by late afternoon.  At the same time, a pronounced dryline pushed across Kansas.  An arc of thunderstorms formed in response to the dryline and moved into western Iowa during the evening.  Initially the airmass was quite unstable when the storms formed  Lifted indices were around -8 C. with CAPE values in the 1500 to 2000 J/kg range.  There were some reports of hail, but that was limited in spite of the 11,500 foot freezing level.  The hail reports that were received were in the three quarter to one inch diameter range.  During the early evening the LCL fell to around 600 meters.  There were two waves of thunderstorms.  The initial set moved through during the period of high winds  over the southwest and central counties.  These storms were very elevated and clearly in an inverted ""V"" sounding environment.  The downdrafts from the storms enhanced the winds as they passed.  One produced downburst winds around 60 MPH in Grimes and tore a trailer door off.  One tornado touched down in Audubon County southwest of Audubon.  The tornado touched down in open fields and did not cause any damage.   There were a few reports of high winds due to the storms.  A combination of two things caused the high winds.  One was the storms themselves initially as the flow in the low levels, the lowest 500 meters, was in the 50 to 60 kt range.  The other occurred as the storms started to weaken.  Soundings indicated that during the dissipation stage, the storms moved into a near storm environment that exhibited an inverted ""V"" sounding.  This was the case in Taylor County at Lenox, where high winds tor the roof off of a hardware store and ripped the roof off of a hog confinement building.  Several hogs were killed at the confinement farm.  In Adams County, high winds resulted in the collapse of strong thunderstorms over the northern part of the county.  The outflow rush produced winds estimated around 75 MPH south of Prescott.  Numerous machine sheds and barns were damaged in the area.  Eight inch diameter trees were downed as well as a few TV and Radio towers.

One estimate for damage done by tornadoes across Middle Tennssee on April 7 was placed at $391 million. Unfortunately, at night, looters came out to Gallatin. A nightly curfew was imposed for a while to curb the looting. The National Guard was called in to help with security matters and debris removal. By May 4, 2006, 23 people were arrested for looting in Gallatin. Several people died inside their homes. A NWS Storm Survey Team discovered that 1/2 million dollar brick homes were not built as well as one might have expected. Cinder blocks were filled with concrete, and boards were nailed to the cinder block as the base for the foundation. The strong winds caused some brick homes to move off the cinder blocks and collapse. This was observed in the Woodhaven Subdivision in Gallatin.",PDS

These storms produced damaging hail up to the size of half dollars and a brief tornado. Several organized multicell and supercell storms were observed. A weak and short-lived tornado formed under an explosively developing and severe updraft in Stonewall County. The only damage to be reported as a result of the severe weather event occured in Cottle County. There heavy rainfall and large hail damaged the interior of a home that was exposed due to ongoing roof repairs.,"Local law enforcement officials reported that a tornado developed beneath a rapidly intensifying severe thunderstorm over west-central Stonewall County. A deputy observed a high-based but well-developed funnel cloud. Dust was observed beneath the funnel, and the debris cloud was seen briefly connecting to the cloud base. The tornado quickly dissipated while remaining in open rangeland, and no damage resulted.",PDS

The airmass had become very unstable with Lifted Indices in the -5 to -8 range.  CAPE values reached 3500 by the late afternoon hours.  Thunderstorms erupted late in the afternoon and became severe very quickly.  The main mode of severe weather with the storms was large hail.  The freezing level was around 12,300 feet.  Though quite high for mid April, it was easily low enough to make hail production easy.  Several of the storms exhibited the structure of a tornadic supercell.  The LCL was quite high however, at around 7300 feet.  This limited the development of tornadoes somewhat.  One tornado touched down in Tama County, northeast of Toledo.  The tornado was on the ground briefly and touched down in an open field.  No damage was reported with the tornado.  Many of the storms produced large hail.  There were numerous reports of one to two inch diameter hail.  A couple of the storms produced very large hail.

The Perry County segment of the tornado was rated at its maximum intensity and width shortly after crossing the county line. Shortly after crossing into Perry County, some coal trucks were blown over, and a modular home was totally destroyed on Route 154 near Route 150. Two persons in the home were trapped inside for a time, but they sustained only minor injuries that were treated at a local hospital. Route 150 was closed for 12 hours due to downed trees and power lines. Within a few miles of the destroyed modular home, some hogs were killed at a hog farm, and an empty grain bin was picked up and blown 100 yards into a field. Several eyewitnesses at this location reported two funnels. As the tornado continued its northeast movement, passing northwest of Pinckneyville, it weakened to F1 intensity. Near where it crossed Illinois Route 13, trees were uprooted, roofs were blown off, and power poles were snapped. Siding was blown off a house. Near the end of the tornado track, just northwest of Tamaroa, a metal building was destroyed. Debris from the building was blown about 400 yards. A nearby house lost all of its shingles. Along the 20-mile path through Perry County, dozens of barns and outbuildings were severely damaged or destroyed. Dozens of homes sustained varying degrees of damage, ranging from minor to major. Hundreds of trees were uprooted or snapped.  Peak winds on this county segment were estimated at 140 MPH, mainly near the Randolph County line. The average path width was close to 200 yards. A deputy sheriff reported a tornado crossing U.S. Highway 51 north of Tamaroa. This was the last evidence of the tornado, which likely dissipated as it crossed Route 51.",PDS

This activity was part of a widespread severe weather event across much of west Texas, including the Permian Basin where at least one significant tornado occurred. Severe convection erupted during the late afternoon hours along a warm front that was oriented west-to-east over the southern portions of the South Plains. These storms quickly evolved into supercells, and produced large hail, damaging winds, and at least four tornadoes. Although the tornadoes remained over open farmland, tornadic winds destroyed to center-pivot irrigation systems northwest of Brownfield (Terry County). This resulted in property losses of half a million dollars.The supercellular convection evolved into a cluster of severe multicell storms by early evening as it continued to propagate eastward along the boundary. A small linear complex characterized by a mini bow-shaped radar echo produced a locally intense downburst near Lake Alan Henry in southeastern Garza County. Winds estimated to exceed 90 MPH destroyed a number of mobile homes and vehicles near the lake, and injured one resident.Total economical losses sustained over the South Plains region during the outbreak were estimated to just under $1 million.",The local broadcast media relayed reports of a brief tornado north of Plains.

These storms evolved into splitting supercells, and resulted in large hail up to two inches in diameter in Dickens and Motley Counties. The anticyclonic member from one of the mentioned storms propagated northward over Childress County during the early evening hours. The storm effectively lowered temperature-to-dewpoint depressions and locally backed the near-surface winds. A classic supercell subsequently propagated southeastward out of the Texas Panhandle and over Hall County. This storm interacted with the ""outflow boundary"" left by the departing anticyclonic storm. The southeastward propagating storm rapidly became tornadic near the northwestern corner of Childress. Large hail, damaging RFD winds, and the significant (F2) tornado resulted in nearly $6 million in damages and injured one. A school net weather instrument located at the heavily damaged Childress High School measured a peak wind gust of 109 MPH as the tornado destroyed the school's gymnasium.A second round of isolated severe storms produced large hail over the extreme southeastern Texas Panhandle as clean-up crews worked in the damaged areas.","A tornado resulted in significant (F2) damage along a one and half mile path through the north side of Childress during the evening hours of the 9th.

A resident was injured when a tree fell and struck him, breaking his arm and causing minor lacerations.The tornado then moved east toward the high school. Damage to the high school was extensive. A local television network, KVII-TV in Amarillo, operates an automated weather station on the campus as part of a regional school net. The instrument measured a 109 MPH wind gust as the tornado ripped through the facility at 20:32 CST. Damage at Childress High School was rated F1, with large brick walls blown inn and portions of the building's roof removed. The gymnasium was declared a total loss.The tornado intensified as it continued to move east across Fair Park. A large industrial building used to house city owned emergency vehicles was completely destroyed, with extensive damage to the fleet of vehicles that were parked inside. A tennis court was destroyed by wind-blown debris, and numerous large trees were uprooted. A large stone picnic table was blown northward along the wind fields convergent axis associated with center of the tornado's path. A well-built metal bridge that spanned Park Lake was blown a considerable distance downwind. Damage along the tornado's path through the park justified a significant rating (F2) on the Fujita Tornado Damage Intensity Scale. This given the magnitude of damage observed at the industrial building site, where large steel beams were completely torn from their bolted fixtures.The damage survey indicated that the tornado quickly weakened as it continued to move east of the park, and into more rural areas in the northeastern outskirts of the city.",PDS

Although the storms were initially non-severe, several outflow boundaries surged west from the convection and intersected the frontal boundary over Lubbock and Lynn Counties. As instability increased during the late afternoon hours, strongly towering cumulus clouds stretched pre-existing spin in the low levels of the atmosphere near the boundary interactions and resulted in at least three non-supercellular tornadoes. One tornado was highly-visible in southeastern Lubbock. The tornadoes were weak (F0), and no damage was reported by local authorities.The thunderstorms continued to intensify over the eastern South Plains during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Several storms eventually became severe with large hail up to the size of quarters and wind gusts up to 64 MPH.",Multiple reports were received of a landspout tornado east of Tahoka. The landspout developed beneath a rapidly developing thunderstorm atop an outflow boundary. Storm spotters reported that the tornado remained in open farm land as it moved west near the intersection of U.S. Highway 380 and Farm to Market Road 1054. No damage was reported.,PDS

This path took it through the southeast corner of the University of Iowa campus.  This was the first tornado to hit near the campus in 35 years and the University was closed on Friday April 14th for safety reasons.The KIOW ASOS at the airport on the southwest side of the city recorded a peak wind gust of 49 knots (57 mph) at 1931 CST.  This gust was likely the result of the rear flank downdraft as the tornado neared the intersection of U.S. 6 and highway 1 northeast of the airport.  Hard times for the location of the tornado are 1930 CST at the Wal-Mart.  At 1932-1933 CST power was lost at the Johnson County Sheriff Office with telephone lines, LAN, and automated systems going down as the tornado passed over the building.  While the tornado was passing over the sheriff's office, someone flipped the outdoor warning sirens from automatic to manual override and activated the sirens one final time.Damage totals are still being evaluated and the $12 million amount will likely be closer to $15 million or possibly higher.  Known damage amounts include; Iowa City and Johnson County $4 million with an additional $755,000 of uninsured loses (traffic lights, signs, street lights), University of Iowa $6 million with the motor pool headquarters a total loss and 31 vehicles damaged, and $1.3 million in damage to residences/businesses.  Three automobile dealerships were damaged; one dealership had 200 vehicles damaged, a second had 60-70 vehicles damaged, and a third had nearly every vehicle sustaining some type of damage.A total of 1,016 residential and 35 commercial buildings were damaged with some destroyed.  Some well known landmark buildings known to citizens, college students, and alumni were lost or heavily damaged.  These included the Dairy Queen (lost) and St. Patrick's Church (heavily damaged).  Several historic buildings were damaged downtown and it is unknown whether or not they can or will be saved.  The tornado damaged the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house and damaged many student apartments located just off the campus on Iowa, Dodge, and Governor streets.Given the strength and width of the tornado it is amazing that only 30 injuries (many minor) occurred.  Many U of I students were unaware of what was happening or dashed to a nearby parking garage for safety with the tornado approaching a few blocks behind them.  Several foreign exchange students, many of whom had never seen, experienced, or heard of a tornado, were in awe and disbelief over the magnitude of the event.  At St. Patrick's Church, the Maundy Thursday evening service had just ended.  Upon being told of an approaching tornado by Decon Jerome Miller, the Reverend Rudolph Juarez ushered 50 to 75 parishioners (many elderly) to the safety of the rectory basement next door.  This action saved the lives of everyone as the tornado tore off the roof off the church and collapsed the top portion of the brick facade and the steeple into the main congregation area.",Rated very high F2 with winds estimated at 155 mph.,PDS

A storm survey of the airport showed that the damage was confined to two large hanger buildings, one of which was brand new, that were constructed mainly from tin, sheet metal panel walls on rigid metal frame. The damage was confined to only the metal panel walls and metal seam roof, with no observed damage to the rigid metal frame. Some interior ""walls"" were damaged, but these were not part of the rigid load-bearing construction, and hanging from the rigid frame and not anchored to the foundation. Ten aircraft, some of which were vintage planes, were also damaged inside the hangars, with 5 planes declared a complete loss. In addition to the numerous videos, there was also some evidence of anti-cyclonic swirls in sprayed aircraft oil. The two structures were estimated at about $1 million.

The 700 mb temperature was in the 14 to 15 C. range, making it difficult for thunderstorm activity to initiate.  Plenty of moisture was available with CAPE values in the 6000 to 8000 J/kg range based on the surface, and near 5000 J/kg in the mixed layer.   Lifted indices fell to near -14 C. by the late afternoon as well.   With the exception of the surface, the lower levels were fairly dry.  The LCL was in excess of 2100 meters by late afternoon. There was plenty of potential for hail with -10 to -30 C layer CAPE in excess of 1000 J/kg, though the freezing level was in excess of 15,500 feet.  Low level lapse rates were in the 8 to 9 C. range in the zero to 3 km layer.  The shear environment was fairly favorable by late afternoon with 30 to 40 kts of effective shear.  A cold front moved southeast across the state during the afternoon.  Ahead of it, a hot and very moist airmass was in place.  Afternoon highs were in the mid 90s to around 100 with dew points in the mid to upper 70s.  Thunderstorms were not able to fire until the late afternoon hours and only over the far eastern part of the CWA.  Once the storms did form, the mode of severe weather was hail.  Hail of golf ball, upwards of 3 inch diameter fell in Black Hawk County at Waterloo.  The hail path began near the airport and then tracked southeast through downtown Waterloo, causing extensive damage.  Tama, Wapello, and Davis Counties were also hit with large hail.  Hail of nearly baseball size pelted the countryside south of Bloomfield.  One brief tornado touched down in Tama County near Tama.  It touched down in an open area just west of town and caused little damage.  During the afternoon  hours, temperatures in Des Moines reached 100 degrees for the first time since August of 2003.

A fairly abnormal weather situation developed during the early afternoon hours of June 18th.  After a large area of stratiform rain moved east out of Wisconsin, a line of  scattered thunderstorms developed on the western edge of the rain shield.  Two storms developed supercellular characteristics and produced a couple tornadoes - one that moved from Dodge County into Washington County, and another brief one in Dane county. In addition, a couple funnel clouds were reported.  Specific details of both tornadoes are found above.  Synoptically, a trough pushed through south-central and southeast Wisconsin during the late morning and afternoon hours.  A moist airmass left behind from morning rain allowed for low cloud base heights.  Sufficient low-level vertical wind shear was present for rotating storms.  Once rotation was evident in the thunderstorms, tornadoes were easily formed because of low cloud heights and decent low-level CAPE.","A tornado spun up at 1326CST at a location 1.5 SSE of Rubicon about 0.2 mile south of the intersection of STH 60 and Resthaven Rd.  It tracked east-southeast and exited Dodge County at 1327CST about 2.4 southeast of Rubicon (or about 0.6 mile south of where STH 60 goes east into Washington Co.).

A fairly abnormal weather situation developed during the early afternoon hours of June 18th.  After a large area of stratiform rain moved east out of Wisconsin, a line of  scattered thunderstorms developed on the western edge of the rain shield.  Two storms developed supercellular characteristics and produced a couple tornadoes - one that moved from Dodge County into Washington County, and another brief one in Dane county. In addition, a couple funnel clouds were reported.  Specific details of both tornadoes are found above.

The tornado strengthened to a high end F1 as it passed through the city.  Around 147 residences sustained at least some damage ranging from tree damage to severe structural damage.  Ten businesses also sustained structural damage.  Lincoln Elementary School's roof was completely destroyed.  Estimated damage amounts totaled about 4 million dollars.  One person was directly injured by the tornado and two others were indirectly injured.  Nobody was killed.

This activity was part of a widespread severe weather event across much of west Texas, including the Permian Basin where at least one significant tornado occurred. Severe convection erupted during the late afternoon hours along a warm front that was oriented west-to-east over the southern portions of the South Plains. These storms quickly evolved into supercells, and produced large hail, damaging winds, and at least four tornadoes. Although the tornadoes remained over open farmland, tornadic winds destroyed to center-pivot irrigation systems northwest of Brownfield (Terry County). This resulted in property losses of half a million dollars.The supercellular convection evolved into a cluster of severe multicell storms by early evening as it continued to propagate eastward along the boundary. A small linear complex characterized by a mini bow-shaped radar echo produced a locally intense downburst near Lake Alan Henry in southeastern Garza County. Winds estimated to exceed 90 MPH destroyed a number of mobile homes and vehicles near the lake, and injured one resident.Total economical losses sustained over the South Plains region during the outbreak were estimated to just under $1 million.","Storm chasers and Skywarn storm spotters observed a third tornado northwest of Brownfield as an occluding mesocyclone produced intermittent tornadoes for more than fifteen minutes. This tornado remained on the ground for at least seven minutes, and tracked across open farmland. Two center-pivot irrigation units were destroyed, however, resulting in $500,000 in property damage.",PDS

The front was more of a dry line than anything as afternoon conditions ahead of the front showed temperatures in the low 80s with dew point readings in the upper 60s to low 70s, while behind it highs were in the upper 80s to low 90s with dew points in the 40s.  The airmass ahead of the front became unstable with CAPE values in the 2000 J/kg range.  Lifted indices fell to around -6 just ahead of the boundary.  The freezing level was relatively low at around 12,000 feet and the environment was conducive for tornado development with LCL levels in the 1000 to 1500 meter range, though the shear environment was relatively week with about 30 kts or so of shear in the 0-3 km level.  Thunderstorms fired during the afternoon and became severe.  Many of the storms produced hail of nickle size to a little larger.  One of the stronger storms produced golf ball size hail south of Floris in Davis County.  The storm also gave a tornadic signature on radar presentation.  There were some reports of wind gusts to around 50 MPH, however winds were not a major factor with this event.  There was one brief tornado touchdown northeast of Bloomfield in Davis County.  The tornado touched down in an open area and there were no reports of damage.",Brief tornado touchdown in open area.,PDS

Based on spotter reports, the tornado was visible at 8:02 pm CDT just south of CR D4800 and west of Farm to Market Road 829 (FM 829), south-southeast of Patricia.  According to spotter reports, it took on a stove-pipe like shape and continued to move to the east-southeast along FM 829.  A few minutes later, the tornado pulled an oil pump jack and well head from the ground.  The pump jack was estimated to weigh about 35,000 pounds by an oil company representative.  The well head was anchored in the ground by an additional 35,000 pounds of weight from pipe below the ground.  Southward along FM 829, four power poles were snapped four to five feet above ground and an additional six poles farther south were blown over to the east due to rear flank downdraft winds.  Another couple of minutes later, an oil heater treater weighing approximately 12,000 pounds was blown over.  The damage survey team classified the damage that occurred between 8:02pm CDT and 8:07pm CDT, when the oil heater treater was blown over, as F2 intensity damage.  After blowing over the oil heater, the tornado became rain-wrapped and crossed County Road 4600, just west of County Road D3401.  Five power poles were knocked down on County Road D3401.  Based on information received from both spotters and chasers, the tornado dissipated at 8:14pm CDT, just west of Texas Highway 137.  During the remainder of the tornado's path, it remained mainly over open country.  The damage survey team calculated the width of the tornado to be 130 yards near the end of its life.  However, the track was estimated to be between 200 and 300 yards during earlier stages of its life.  The path length was calculated to be just over six miles long.",PDS

Although storm damage was reported from the Connecticut Valley region to the Worcester Hills and Merrimack Valley, damage was especially severe in eastern Franklin County as well as Boston's North Shore.Early in the afternoon, one cluster of thunderstorms formed in Franklin County and rapidly became severe, causing considerable damage in Montague and especially Wendell.A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service concluded the damage in Wendell was caused by a combination of straight-line wind damage and a tornado, which was rated as a strong F2 on the Fujita Scale with winds estimated near 155 mph.Damage began around 230 pm EDT, about 200 yards west of Montague Road. Wind damage extended from Montague Road about 1.5 miles east to Wicket Pond in the Wendell State Forest. Large oak, maple, and pine trees were uprooted and snapped in this area. Some oaks over two feet in diameter were snapped about 10 to 15 feet from the ground. Damage from this microburst extended along a path of one and a half miles in length, and anywhere from 50 to 300 yards in width. Wind speeds were estimated near 90 mph.Tornado damage first appeared on the northeast corner of Wicket Pond. An eyewitness reported seeing a six foot wave form on the pond. On the west side of the pond, many trees were snapped 15 to 20 feet above the ground, with debris left in a chaotic pattern.The next area of damage was on Wicket Pond Road, which is where the most severe damage occurred. Trees as large as 3 feet in diameter were uprooted. Bark was stripped off trees and a house had part of its roof torn off. The tornado tracked to the east along Wicket Pond Road, passing over Depot Road which is in Wendell Center. Part of a roof was torn off an old barn and many trees were uprooted.After crossing Depot Road, the tornado continued to track to the east, passing north of Morse Village Road. A construction storage trailer was completely destroyed and its roof was wrapped around a tree. Trees were also uprooted or snapped in this area. Damage came to an end about one half mile east of New Salem Road.The path length of the tornado was approximately 3 miles. Its average width was 200 yards, varying from 100 to 300 yards.A little more than one hour later, another cluster of severe thunderstorms brought significant damage to Cape Ann, in particular Marblehead Neck and the adjacent coastal waters. Initially, the storms produced hail as large as 3 inches in diameter - just larger than baseball size - which are considered to be the second largest hailstones reported in Massachusetts.A National Weather Service storm survey concluded that multiple wet microbursts, or sudden outflow of damaging straight-line winds combined with torrential rainfall, impacted the area around Marblehead Neck between 357 pm and 430 pm EDT. The survey noted that westerly winds gusting as high as 90 mph occurred in an area centered from Marblehead Harbor across Corinthian Lane and Barker Lane, and then out to sea. The land damage path was short, primarily because the land is only about 700 feet wide in that area.The main damage path was about 150 feet wide. It consisted of tree damage and minor structural damage, although substantial damage was noted to sailing vessels and at least one car. Damage was more sporadic near Manley Street, about 600 feet farther north, and also to the south and southwest on Foster Street, Harbor Avenue, and Ocean Avenue.Interviews with eyewitnesses provide more detail as to how the storms affected the area. Between 340 pm and 345 pm EDT, winds shifted to the northeast and produced sea spray at the mouth of Marblehead Harbor. This was the result of earlier thunderstorms passing north of the area. Then, from 357 pm to 405 pm EDT, a white tempest developed over Marblehead Harbor on the neck side of the harbor, estimated by the Corinthian Yacht Club chair to be about 300 yards upstream from the dock. This curtain of water and high winds advanced toward the yacht club, lifting 30-foot vessels approximately 20 feet in the air and catapulting them end over end toward the dock. An anemometer on the dock was viewed to have reached 95 mph before it blew off its mast. Damage was less severe, but still significant, from the Connecticut Valley to the Worcester Hills and Merrimack Valley. There were many reports of downed trees, large branches, and hail up to the size of quarters from the Springfield area to Grafton, Westborough, and Framingham as well as farther northeast into Hardwick, Wilmington, and Boxford.Torrential rainfall caused significant urban flooding, especially in Springfield, Oxford, Wakefield, and Beverly. In Salem, two cars on Pope Street were submerged by up to 3 feet of water when about 2 inches of rain fell in 20 minutes. Other cars were flooded in Salem and Lynn due to other roads being flooded, including a stretch of Route 129.Lightning struck Athol Memorial Hospital, causing minor damage to the facility.",Brief F2 Touchdown in Wendell,PDS

After touching down just west of the Arena, It knocked down a section of fence and shattered windows in a structure at an arena just to the east of the fence.  The tornado moved on to the southern end of a campground, flipping over a trailer and ripping the sheet metal roofing off a building.  It moved east-southeastward across several businesses between Industrial Blvd. and U.S. Highway 50.  A lawn care business building had a large section of its eastern wall destroyed.  Several trailers, boats, and vehicles were moved by the high winds.

A strong cold front moved from the Appalachian Mountains to the Mid Atlantic during the afternoon. The cold front reached to along the Chesapeake Bay around midnight. The most intense thunderstorms occurred along the Interstate 95 corridor, with one confirmed F1 tornado in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Intense thunderstorm winds also occurred across the tidal waters of the Potomac and Chesapeake.","The National Weather Service conducted a storm survey in Severna Park and Pasadena Maryland, rating the tornado an F1 on the Fujita scale of tornado intensity. It was determined that a the tornado touched down in the area of Severna Park about 6:34 pm, and traveled two miles before lifting in Pasadena around 6:44 pm. At its maximum the storm was 250 yards wide with winds of 90 mph. 34 homes were severely damaged by falling trees with 13 of those homes rendered uninhabitable. Initial minor damage was located near the intersection of Ritchie Highway and McKinsey Avenue. A hardware store had its sign blown down and a small tree was downed near the Severna Park Marketplace Shopping Center. A few trees were also downed immediately behind the shopping center along Leelynn Road. The tornado gathered strength as it progressed through West Ridge and towards Cattail Creek off of the Magothy River. Five large hardwood trees of one to two feet in diameter were uprooted, and several others were snapped off along Whittier Parkway. Two of the large trees had fallen through houses. These trees, as most of the trees were in the survey, were blown down nearly perpendicular to the path of the tornado (knocked down towards the west). The tornado then reached its most intense and widest extent as it passed through the community of Lower Magothy Beach. Many of these trees knocked down in this area were large two foot diameter hardwood trees that were 60 to 80 feet tall. Leaf spatter was noted on the sides of homes and vehicles. Slight siding damage was noted on one home. Many wires and telephone poles were knocked down in this area. The width of the tornado at this point was 250 yards. Damage became much more limited as the tornado continued north across Norwich Road and Inverness Road in Riverdale. By the time the storm crossed the Magothy for the final time and traveled over the community of Beachwood Park, only leaf litter and small downed branches were noted.",PDS

This strong weather system developed as a very strong jet stream, with winds between 160-200 mph, slammed into Oregon and Washington State. All that energy moved over the Rocky Mountains and caused a strong area of surface low pressure to develop. This low intensified as it moved east across the Red River Valley and then lifted across Arkansas and into Tennessee as it deepened to 990 mb! The strength of this deepening low caused warm and unstable air to lift northward across Louisiana and into central Mississippi. It was this northward moving warm front that became the focus of an area where tornadic supercell thunderstorms could thrive in an unstable and highly sheared environment.|This large and powerful storm system produced numerous tornadoes across the south and south eastern United States where many were of the strong (F2 or F3) variety. Within the Jackson, MS forecast area, there were a total of 5 tornadoes to impact the counties serviced. Two F3s, one in Lamar County and the other in Jones County. The Jones County tornado actually contained a satellite tornado, F1, which briefly rotated around the parent tornado. Next was an F1 tornado in southern Marion County which was actually the end of a strong tornado that moved out of Walthall County. Lastly, a brief F1 tornado occurred in central Lamar County. Tornadoes were not the only type of severe weather, scattered wind damage also occurred across northeast Louisiana and portions of central Mississippi between midnight and 10 am Wednesday November 15th 2006.","This strong tornado touched down near the Glade and Tuckers Crossing Communities and tracked east northeast to near the Mill Creek Community before entering Wayne County near Highway 84. Around 25 homes suffered significant damage. The most intense damage was along a path from near the intersection of Highway 15 and Orange Drive northeast to the area along Township Road. Two metal high tension electric power truss towers were destroyed, hundreds of trees were snapped and uprooted, at least two mobile homes were destroyed, a travel trailer being used for post-Katrina housing was annihilated, and several houses suffered significant structural damage. Northeast of this area, the path continued all the way to the county line with Wayne County, but damage was generally less, F0 to occasionally F1, and limited to tree damage. The one exception was near the Mill Creek community, where a storage building was destroyed and a couple of homes suffered roof damage.

The event was set up by an anomalous pool of tropical type moisture (300% of normal) over the western Gulf of Mexico which was then pulled northward by strong low level winds in advance of a westward moving upper level disturbance. There were several other factors in play which contributed to the large amounts of rain, such as a northward moving warm front and a building upper ridge over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The warm front helped lift the air while the building upper ridge served to weaken the westward moving upper disturbance. This then caused the progression of the heavy convective rains to slow and dump tremendous amounts of rain from southeast Texas to north and central Louisiana and then into west-central Mississippi. By late evening, dry mid level air began pushing east from Texas and allowed the heavy rain shield to move and exit the region by early Tuesday morning. Heavy rains were not the only weather type during this event, a couple of tornadoes occurred along with scattered reports of wind damage. |What makes this event rare is that such a large area received 6 to 10 inches of rain and an even larger area received 4 to 6 inches.

The event was set up by an anomalous pool of tropical type moisture (300% of normal) over the western Gulf of Mexico which was then pulled northward by strong low level winds in advance of a westward moving upper level disturbance. There were several other factors in play which contributed to the large amounts of rain, such as a northward moving warm front and a building upper ridge over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The warm front helped lift the air while the building upper ridge served to weaken the westward moving upper disturbance. This then caused the progression of the heavy convective rains to slow and dump tremendous amounts of rain from southeast Texas to north and central Louisiana and then into west-central Mississippi. By late evening, dry mid level air began pushing east from Texas and allowed the heavy rain shield to move and exit the region by early Tuesday morning.

Georgia was on the eastern edge of this outbreak because much of north and central Georgia remained in a wedge of cooler air.  However, a nose of warm, moist air from central and southern Alabama worked its way into the Columbus area of west central Georgia.  Dewpoints in the Columbus area rose into the lower 60s helping to fuel the environment in that region for strong storms.   A strong squall line of thunderstorms from central and southern Alabama worked its way into west central Georgia shortly after noon, spawning a tornado in the Fort Benning area.  The line of thunderstorms weakened considerably as it moved further east into the cooler, more stable air.  Thus, little severe weather was reported further east.|In addition to the severe weather, rainfall of two to four inches across much of north and west Georgia resulted in several street flooding incidents, especially in the Columbus area.  Strong winds, particularly at the higher elevations in the north Georgia counties, resulted in a number of trees being blown down.","A survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, GA concluded that an F1 tornado had touched down at the intersection of Sightseeing Road and Lavoy Road in the northern portion of Fort Benning and traveled north-northeast toward the Upatoi Creek and the Muscogee county line.  The tornado crossed just across the border into Muscogee county before lifting.  Moderate damage was observed within the Main Post area of Fort Benning along a 150-yard wide, 1.5-mile long path.  The majority of the damage occurred along Wold Avenue, where about 10 World War II warehouses were heavily damage, and 18-wheel truck was flipped over, and two vehicles were damaged from debris.  Several trees and power lines were also down in the area.  Six homes were also damaged in the McDonald Manor Housing Area from large downed trees and limbs.  Nine minor injuries were reported in this area as a result of flying or falling debris.",CSV

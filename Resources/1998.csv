Other tornadoes damaged the Oklahoma City Boat Club, portions of The Village and Nichols Hills, the Highland Park neighborhood west of Broadway Extension, and the area near May and Grand Avenues in Oklahoma City. Three weak tornadoes also touched down in open country northwest of El Reno and near Yukon. In addition to damaging tornadoes, the storm produced extensive straight-line wind damage from Lake Hefner, across Nichols Hills and The Village, into northeast Oklahoma County. Winds likely exceeded 100 mph in some areas. There were no fatalities and only 21 relatively minor injuries reported in Oklahoma County. The majority of the injuries were sustained at the Frontier City theme park. Earlier, another supercell thunderstorm produced tornadoes near Longdale in Blaine County and 3 miles southwest of Guthrie.

National Weather Service meteorologists conducted a survey of the area and found a damage path 5 1/4 miles long and 3/4 of a mile wide with F3 damage occurring 2 miles west of Lamont where a well-built brick home had all of its exterior walls destroyed. In addition, 6 single-family homes were destroyed 1.5 miles south of Lamont, while in the city of Lamont 3 single-family dwellings sustained major damage. Nine single-family homes sufferred minor damage. Nearly a dozen vehicles were destroyed, including automobiles, pickup trucks, farm trucks, and farm tractors. Several barns were destroyed including one barn where 30 sheep were also killed. More than 70 utility poles were ripped down in a 3 mile stretch. The Lamont tornado, as it is referred, was unusual in its direction of movement. Several eye witnesses reported a southeast to northwest movement. WSR-88D data also showed the mesocyclone associated with the tornado moving from south to north in a looping manner when the tornado was reported.

The fourteenth tornado, an F0, was reported by spotters to have touched down briefly in an open field causing no damage.                          The most destructive tornado occurred near the city of Lamont where damage estimates reached 2 million dollars.  National Weather Service meteorologists conducted a survey of the area and found a damage path 5 1/4 miles long and 3/4 of a mile wide with F3 damage occurring 2 miles west of Lamont where a well-built brick home had all of its exterior walls destroyed. In addition, 6 single-family homes were destroyed 1.5 miles south of Lamont, while in the city of Lamont 3 single-family dwellings sustained major damage. Nine single-family homes sufferred minor damage. Nearly a dozen vehicles were destroyed, including automobiles, pickup trucks, farm trucks, and farm tractors. Several barns were destroyed including one barn where 30 sheep were also killed. More than 70 utility poles were ripped down in a 3 mile stretch. The Lamont tornado, as it is referred, was unusual in its direction of movement. Several eye witnesses reported a southeast to northwest movement. WSR-88D data also showed the mesocyclone associated with the tornado moving from south to north in a looping manner when the tornado was reported. The last tornado, the sixteenth of this episode, touched down briefly in an open field 5 miles northwest of Tonkawa at 2130 CST. Tonkawa Emergency Management reported no damage. Thus, this tornado was rated an F0.    In addition to these tornadoes, a large macroburst containing damaging straight-line winds occurred from 13 miles west of Medford (Grant County) to 4 miles west northwest of Pond Creek. Satellite dishes owned by Classic Cable Company, which were rated at 110 mph, were flattened by the winds. Straight-line wind damage was also reported in Alva where one man sustained minor injuries when he was blown into the bed of a pickup truck. Also in Alva at least 3 mobile homes suffered major damage; several carports were destroyed; awning and minor roof damage occurred to many homes; and trees and power lines were blown down. One indirect fatality occurred in Alva when a man slipped and suffered a heart attack while seeking shelter in a storm cellar. Other reports of straight-line wind damage include major roof damage to an old schoolhouse gymnasium in the city of Jefferson in Grant County. Two large cedar trees were also uprooted in Jefferson. A tree limb was blown through a picture window 14 miles north northeast of Camp Houston in Woods County. Windows were also blown out of a shed, and numerous trees were downed. Four to six inch tree limbs were blown down 9 miles west of Cherokee in Alfalfa County.  In Thomas in Custer County one utility pole was snapped and large limbs were blown down. Power lines were knocked down in Edmond in Oklahoma County. Severe winds also damaged the roof of the Fred Humphrey Pavillion in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County. The largest hail reported measured 3.5 inches in diameter and occurred in Medford in Grant County. Three reported events of at least tennis ball size hail occurred in Goltry (Alfalfa County) in less than 2 hours: tennis ball size hail at 2140 CST and 2230 CST, and baseball size hail at 2305 CST. Between 30 and 100 percent of the wheat crop was destroyed due to large hail from about 2 miles west of Jet to near Goltry. Another area south of Cherokee, near the junction of US 64 and SH 8 also sustained major wheat crop damage. In addition numerous vehicles had their windows broken. Tennis ball size hail also damaged the wheat crop and numerous vehicles in Okarche in Canadian County while in Watonga in Blaine County golf ball size hail damaged RV vehicles and street lights. Quarter size hail damaged several vehicles 6 miles north of Piedmont in Canadian County. Lightning struck a house in Piedmont causing a house to catch on fire. The last of the severe thunderstorms moved through northern Oklahoma during the early morning of May 25th, resulting in flooding near Cherokee and the National Wildlife Refuge in Alfalfa County, where 5.5 inches of rain fell. Several streets and the city park were also flooded in Blackwell in Kay County during the evening of May 24th.",,PDC

At least 22 tornadoes occurred throughout Oklahoma, of which seven were in northeast Oklahoma.  This outbreak of severe weather resulted as a powerful upper level storm system moved across the central plains and surface low pressure developed over southwest Oklahoma.  Warm humid air quickly invaded the area on the morning of October 4 and then collided with a cold front moving southward by evening.  The threat from these storms ran the full range of possibilities from destructive tornadoes to damaging winds to very large hail up to the size of baseballs.Numerous storms occurred on the evening of October 4, mainly north of Interstate 40.  The two most significant storms both moved eastward out of central Oklahoma.  One produced an F1 tornado that passed through Pawnee.  The other produced a 27-mile track F2 tornado that started in Okfuskee County and ended in Okmulgee County.  This second storm later went on to produce considerable hail and wind damage in the city of Okmulgee.  Many other thunderstorms developed during the evening in central Oklahoma, fanned by upper level winds in excess of 100 knots.  These storms moved into northeast Oklahoma, causing additional severe weather late in the evening that gradually spread eastward to the Arkansas state line.  After midnight, the storms congealed and became a slow-moving line of thunderstorms that sat over nearly the same area of northeast Oklahoma through the overnight hours.  The severe threat gradually diminished through the night, and flooding became the main problem.  For more information on the flooding, see the separate event entry for the flooding.  By late on the afternoon of October 5, the slow-moving line had moved into southeast Oklahoma and flared up during the heat of the afternoon, causing a few additional severe weather reports in the form of strong winds.",The same parent thunderstorm that produced a 27-mile tornado track through Okfuskee and Okmulgee Counties produced another more short-lived tornado just southeast of Tullahassee.  The tornado itself produced a swath of damage through a forested area and caused roof damage to one house.  The parent thunderstorm also produced winds that knocked down trees in Tullahassee around 1230 AM CDT.,PDC

The strongest tornado, an F3, occurred near Lamont in Grant County. There were also reports of hail up to 3.5 inches in diameter, straight line wind damage, and flooding. The first tornado, an F0, touched down in an open field 1 mile south of Amorita in Alfalfa County at 1745 CST lasting for less than one minute with no reports of damage. The second tornado, also an F0, was reported 5 minutes later by media chasers to have touched down in an open field 3 miles east northeast of Amorita. Touchdown was very brief with no damage reported. The third tornado was also observed by media chasers, this time in northeast Alfalfa County 8 miles east of Amorita. The tornado, an F1, damaged one house and knocked down power lines as it moved southeast and weakened while crossing into western Grant County for a total damage path lengh of 5 miles. There were no reports of damage with this segment of the tornado in Grant County and thus was rated an F0. An unusual aspect of this tornado was that it was reported to be rotating anticyclonically. The fourth and fifth tornadoes were also rated F0, the fourth reported by media chasers to have touched down in an open field 4 west northwest of Wakita with no damage, and the fifth observed by Wakita Fire Department to be on the ground for 2.5 miles from 2 miles southwest of Wakita to 2 miles south of Wakita. No damage was reported. An off-duty National Weather Service meteorologist observed the sixth tornado, an F0, in an open field 9 miles west of Medford. The seventh tornado, also an F0, produced no damage as it rotated anticyclonically 3 miles southeast of Wakita. The eighth and ninth tornadoes, both F0, occurred simultaneously 6 miles west of Medford. The eighth tornado touched down just north of Highway 11 while the ninth tornado touched down just south of Highway 11. One house and a business were damaged by the tenth tornado which occurred in Grant County from 2 miles southwest of Medford to 2 miles south of Medford.  The eleventh tornado, an F0, was observed by an off duty National Weather Service meteorologist to be knocking down trees and power lines in a 5 mile long damage path in southern Grant County. The twelvth tornado, an F1, snapped trees in half and damaged a private airstrip 4 miles east northeast of Pond Creek while the thirteenth tornado, also an F1, damaged several homes and knocked down trees and power lines 1 mile north of Salt Fork. The fourteenth tornado, an F0, was reported by spotters to have touched down briefly in an open field causing no damage.                          The most destructive tornado occurred near the city of Lamont where damage estimates reached 2 million dollars.  National Weather Service meteorologists conducted a survey of the area and found a damage path 5 1/4 miles long and 3/4 of a mile wide with F3 damage occurring 2 miles west of Lamont where a well-built brick home had all of its exterior walls destroyed. In addition, 6 single-family homes were destroyed 1.5 miles south of Lamont, while in the city of Lamont 3 single-family dwellings sustained major damage. Nine single-family homes sufferred minor damage. Nearly a dozen vehicles were destroyed, including automobiles, pickup trucks, farm trucks, and farm tractors. Several barns were destroyed including one barn where 30 sheep were also killed. More than 70 utility poles were ripped down in a 3 mile stretch. The Lamont tornado, as it is referred, was unusual in its direction of movement. Several eye witnesses reported a southeast to northwest movement. WSR-88D data also showed the mesocyclone associated with the tornado moving from south to north in a looping manner when the tornado was reported. The last tornado, the sixteenth of this episode, touched down briefly in an open field 5 miles northwest of Tonkawa at 2130 CST. Tonkawa Emergency Management reported no damage. Thus, this tornado was rated an F0.    In addition to these tornadoes, a large macroburst containing damaging straight-line winds occurred from 13 miles west of Medford (Grant County) to 4 miles west northwest of Pond Creek. Satellite dishes owned by Classic Cable Company, which were rated at 110 mph, were flattened by the winds. Straight-line wind damage was also reported in Alva where one man sustained minor injuries when he was blown into the bed of a pickup truck. Also in Alva at least 3 mobile homes suffered major damage; several carports were destroyed; awning and minor roof damage occurred to many homes; and trees and power lines were blown down. One indirect fatality occurred in Alva when a man slipped and suffered a heart attack while seeking shelter in a storm cellar. Other reports of straight-line wind damage include major roof damage to an old schoolhouse gymnasium in the city of Jefferson in Grant County. Two large cedar trees were also uprooted in Jefferson. A tree limb was blown through a picture window 14 miles north northeast of Camp Houston in Woods County. Windows were also blown out of a shed, and numerous trees were downed. Four to six inch tree limbs were blown down 9 miles west of Cherokee in Alfalfa County.  In Thomas in Custer County one utility pole was snapped and large limbs were blown down. Power lines were knocked down in Edmond in Oklahoma County. Severe winds also damaged the roof of the Fred Humphrey Pavillion in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County. The largest hail reported measured 3.5 inches in diameter and occurred in Medford in Grant County. Three reported events of at least tennis ball size hail occurred in Goltry (Alfalfa County) in less than 2 hours: tennis ball size hail at 2140 CST and 2230 CST, and baseball size hail at 2305 CST. Between 30 and 100 percent of the wheat crop was destroyed due to large hail from about 2 miles west of Jet to near Goltry. Another area south of Cherokee, near the junction of US 64 and SH 8 also sustained major wheat crop damage. In addition numerous vehicles had their windows broken. Tennis ball size hail also damaged the wheat crop and numerous vehicles in Okarche in Canadian County while in Watonga in Blaine County golf ball size hail damaged RV vehicles and street lights. Quarter size hail damaged several vehicles 6 miles north of Piedmont in Canadian County. Lightning struck a house in Piedmont causing a house to catch on fire. The last of the severe thunderstorms moved through northern Oklahoma during the early morning of May 25th, resulting in flooding near Cherokee and the National Wildlife Refuge in Alfalfa County, where 5.5 inches of rain fell. Several streets and the city park were also flooded in Blackwell in Kay County during the evening of May 24th.",,PDC

Three tornadoes were also sighted. Storms first developed in Kay County during the late morning where a semi-truck was blown over 1.5 miles southwest of Blackwell near the intersection of Highway 11 and Interstate 35. Severe thunderstorms then redeveloped over Major and Blaine Counties a few hours later. As these storms moved east into Garfield County, a tornado was spotted 3 miles south of Waukomis moving east. This tornado, rated an F1, knocked down or snapped 40 to 50 power poles, damaged several outbuildings, and destroyed numerous trees. One large diesel storage tank was picked up and desposited one-half mile away. A pickup truck containing 2 occupants was also picked up a short distance from the road and dropped on the side of the road near a creek. Both occupants were uninjured. A semi-trailer was also blown off the highway. As the tornado dissipated, severe thunderstorm winds blew down large tree limbs in Bison, and lightning from the same complex of thunderstorms struck a house in Enid, causing a short in the wiring, which then started a small house fire. Large tree limbs were also downed in Seiling in Dewey County, while a rain gutter from a house was ripped off by the winds 12 miles east of Hennessey in Kingfisher County breaking several flower pots. Large tree limbs were also downed in the same location.As the thunderstorms moved into Logan County, Oklahoma Mesonet measured wind gusts of 59 mph and 66 mph at 1620 CST and 1630 CST respectively 3 miles southeast of Marshall. A weak, F0 tornado was then spotted 9 miles north of Crescent, just west of State Highway 74. The tornado uprooted several trees while crossing the highway, then quickly dissipated. Another weak tornado, an F0, was spotted on the Blaine/Dewey County border 2 miles west of Canton, knocking down trees and power poles. The same thunderstorm was responsible for a lightning strike at the Old Christian Church in Eagle City in Blaine County causing a fire that destroyed the church. As these storms moved east, thunderstorm winds damaged a fence, silo, and several trees in Logan County 3 miles southwest of Langston. Several power poles were blown down 1 mile north of Loyal in Kingfisher County, while in the city of Loyal 13 power poles were snapped, and large tree limbs were blown down. Widespread wind damage occurred in the city of Kingfisher consisting of downed trees and power lines over a 12 square block area on the northwest side of the city. The garage of a house also shifted causing roof damage. Oklahoma Mesonet measured wind gusts of 63 mph and 80 mph at 1900 CST and 1905 CST respectively 4 miles southwest of Guthrie in Logan County. Straight-line winds then produced a large swath of damage to mobile homes, house roofs, trees, power poles and power lines in a 4 by 6 mile area across southern Logan County bounded by Western Ave to the west, Interstate 35 to the east, Forest Hills Road to the north, and Waterloo Road to the south. The worst damage occurred in a 1/2 by 1 1/2 mile area near Oak Cliff. Two-hundred fifty residents were damaged. Of these, 10 homes and business building were destroyed, while 41 structures suffered major damage. One hundred sixty-one single family homes, 43 mobile homes, 7 businesses, and 1 apartment complex suffered minor structural damage. Total damage estimates were near 3.5 million dollars. Five persons were injured, consisting mostly of broken fingers and cuts. No one was seriously injured. Lightning also struck an oil tank at Pine and Industrial in Guthrie, starting a fire that was quickly extinguised.Unusually strong straight-line winds also left a swath of damage roughly 8 miles long and 2 miles wide from just east of Jones in eastern Oklahoma County, east-southeast into extreme western Lincoln County 3 miles northeast of Harrah. A two year-old boy was killed, and ten persons were injured, 8 of which were transported to local hospitals. Damage was estimated at about 2 million dollars. Damage was intermittent from east of Jones to north of Horseshoe Lake and was limited mainly to fallen tree limbs. A more persistent area of wind damage about 1.5 miles wide was found from near Luther Road and Wilshire southeast to near the county line and Northeast 50th. Widespread tree damage occurred in this area along with structural damage to several homes. By far the most concentrated area of damage was along a half-mile wide swath from Harrah Road and 63rd extending east-southeast. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed in this area, one of which disintegrated with the frame left wrapped around a tree. All of the destroyed mobile homes were perpendicular to the wind or nearly so and thus were hit broadside by the full force of the wind. The level of damage in this swath is estimated at strong F1 suggesting that maximum winds probably were between 100 and 110 mph.Damage in Lincoln County consisted of downed power lines, uprooted trees, and damaged outbuildings in a half-mile wide by one-mile long swath just north of Highway 62. One barn also disintegrated as it was picked up by the wind and carried nearly one-quarter of a mile. In total, 75 homes were damaged; 11 suffered major damage, and six (All mobile homes) were destroyed. Three mobile homes were found to be totally disintegrated and one other that was rolled from its foundation. Several eyewitness reports indicated that at least some of these mobile homes were airborne while or just before they were destroyed. The fatality, and most of the injuries, were residents who were in the destroyed mobile homes when the winds struck. The last report of damage in Lincoln County occurred in Chandler, where lightning struck numerous transformers and power poles, knocking out power to all of Chandler for 5 hours.Severe thunderstorm winds also downed trees, wires, and numerous power poles all across the city of Edmond in Oklahoma County. Seven thousand residents were left without power for several hours. One tree fell on a car, and the canopy was blown off at Juffy Lube on 2nd Street, east of Bryant. Farther south and east, a tree was blown down near the Mazzio's Pizza on State Highway in Cushing in Payne County; highway signs and numerous trees were downed near Highway 44 in Cleveland County 4 miles west of Moore, and trees and power lines were blown down in Norman, also in Cleveland County. Lightning struck an oil tank battery in Slaughterville in Cleveland County, causing a fire that burned for about 1 hour before being extinguished. A mobile home was blown off its foundation and destroyed in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County. Five persons were inside the home including 3 children who were injured from minor cuts and bruises. The roof was also blown off of a boathouse at Shawnee Lake, also in Pottawatomie County. Numerous Numerous power lines were downed 8 miles east of Pauls Valley in Garvin County knocking out power to 500 residents, while a house sustained significant roof damage from strong winds. Rain poured into the house causing an estimated $20,000 in damage. Power lines and large tree limbs were downed in Wewoka in Seminole County and Holdenville in Hughes County. Lastly, Lightning struck a tree in Sulphur in Murray County, killing 3 cows and an angus bull standing under it.",,PDC

This set the stage for the development of severe weather later that afternoon as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From late in the afternoon until late that evening, northeastern Pennsylvania was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, nine separate tornadoes touched down on this day.  Overall damage estimates run into the millions with many homes and structures heavily damaged or destroyed.  The most devastating storms occurred in Pike county.  Within about a 3 hour stretch from 7 to 10 pm EDT, four different twisters affected the county.  One tornadic cell was responsible for knocking down thousands of healthy large trees in and around Promised Land State Park with several vacation homes damaged or leveled.  Fortunately, injuries were kept at a minimum.       Widespread straight line wind damage also occurred with hailstones the size of ping pong balls falling in some places.  The north side of Scranton had extensive wind damage as a storm passed through shortly before 10 pm EDT and sections of Wayne and Luzerne counties had roads closed and/or blocked from falling trees for more than 2 days after the storm.  Pennsylvania Power and Light Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power at the height of the storms on the evening of the 31st.

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.",,PDC

Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.",,PDC

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.",,PDC

Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.",,PDC

The episode was highlighted by supercell thunderstorms which produced three tornadoes, numerous instances of large hail, and several downbursts.The most substantial event was a strong-to-violent tornado which caused excessive damage in western Allegany Co.  The multi-vortex twister had estimated wind speeds of 210 mph - the highest in recorded Maryland history - when it ravaged a neighborhood of well-constructed single-family homes along a local plateau just north of Frostburg.  The tornado was on the ground for an amazing 33 miles, beginning in Somerset Co, Pennsylvania before crossing northeastern Garrett Co Maryland on its way to Allegany Co.  The parent supercell tracked over 200 miles.  After descending Big Savage Mountain, the twister produced a swath of destruction across a neighborhood just west of Frostburg.  At least eight homes were destroyed and dozens others were damaged.  Several cars were damaged, and some were totalled.  One two-story home was obliterated.  Left in the wake was the foundation and some remnant plywood.  The residents of the home - a woman and two children - received ample warning and rode out the storm to safety in the basement.  Advance warning likely saved several lives and reduced casualties; in all, only 5 area residents sustained minor injuries.The tornado continued through Eckhart Mines and Clarysville, causing further damage and destruction to homes and other property.  It then continued through undeveloped areas, then passed across Dans Mountain before damaging a few more residences along state route 53 just north of Cresaptown.  The twister lifted at that point, but the parent thunderstorm continued producing damage into eastern West Virginia.  In all, emergency management officials reported 29 homes destroyed and 125 damaged, with nearly half of the surviving homes receiving moderate to major levels of damage.  Initial dollar estimates ranged from $4.5 to $5 million.  Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of trees in forested and developed areas were snapped or uprooted.  The supercell was so powerful that Frostburg area residents' papers, including personal checks and one high school diploma - were found over 50 miles downstream in the northern Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia.The ""Frostburg Tornado"" was not the only twister to affect the county.  The area had been on high alert since early evening - tornado warnings had been issued two other times, and funnel clouds were observed by several witnesses prior to sunset.  One of the funnels touched down not too far from where the Frostburg Tornado entered the county - along the west side of Big Savage Mountain nearly 2 hours earlier.  The funnel lifted while over Frostburg and nearby communities, and continued through Cumberland before touching down again on Irons Mountain 2-3 miles southeast of the city.  In each instance, damage was limited to forested areas along the ridges.Tornadoes were just a portion of the severe weather to affect northern Maryland.  The other major player was hail, with dozens of occurrences associated with each mini-supercell.  The strongest cells produced hailstones ranging from 1.75"" to 2.50"" in diameter; the strong updrafts in each storm combined with steep atmospheric lapse rates to produce not only large hail but long-duration hail as well.  Some areas experienced up to 20 minutes of  hail, and many residents noted hail which covered the ground.  Reported damage included some stripped siding, varying sized dings and dents, as well as shattered glass,  in numerous vehicles; stripped paint from homes and vehicles, small limb and leaf debris, and likely crop damage or destruction.  The main hail-producing storm affected portions of northern Montgomery, Howard, southern Carroll, southern Baltimore, and northern Prince George's and Anne Arundel Cos - all between 1800 and 1945EST.The episode concluded in Maryland with a few wind damage reports on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay just before midnight.  Winds blew out the door to the Annapolis (Anne Arundel Co) city fire department station, and knocked several large trees down in Eastport at approximately the same time.",,PDC

Three tornadoes were also sighted. Storms first developed in Kay County during the late morning where a semi-truck was blown over 1.5 miles southwest of Blackwell near the intersection of Highway 11 and Interstate 35. Severe thunderstorms then redeveloped over Major and Blaine Counties a few hours later. As these storms moved east into Garfield County, a tornado was spotted 3 miles south of Waukomis moving east. This tornado, rated an F1, knocked down or snapped 40 to 50 power poles, damaged several outbuildings, and destroyed numerous trees. One large diesel storage tank was picked up and desposited one-half mile away. A pickup truck containing 2 occupants was also picked up a short distance from the road and dropped on the side of the road near a creek. Both occupants were uninjured. A semi-trailer was also blown off the highway. As the tornado dissipated, severe thunderstorm winds blew down large tree limbs in Bison, and lightning from the same complex of thunderstorms struck a house in Enid, causing a short in the wiring, which then started a small house fire. Large tree limbs were also downed in Seiling in Dewey County, while a rain gutter from a house was ripped off by the winds 12 miles east of Hennessey in Kingfisher County breaking several flower pots. Large tree limbs were also downed in the same location.As the thunderstorms moved into Logan County, Oklahoma Mesonet measured wind gusts of 59 mph and 66 mph at 1620 CST and 1630 CST respectively 3 miles southeast of Marshall. A weak, F0 tornado was then spotted 9 miles north of Crescent, just west of State Highway 74. The tornado uprooted several trees while crossing the highway, then quickly dissipated. Another weak tornado, an F0, was spotted on the Blaine/Dewey County border 2 miles west of Canton, knocking down trees and power poles. The same thunderstorm was responsible for a lightning strike at the Old Christian Church in Eagle City in Blaine County causing a fire that destroyed the church. As these storms moved east, thunderstorm winds damaged a fence, silo, and several trees in Logan County 3 miles southwest of Langston. Several power poles were blown down 1 mile north of Loyal in Kingfisher County, while in the city of Loyal 13 power poles were snapped, and large tree limbs were blown down. Widespread wind damage occurred in the city of Kingfisher consisting of downed trees and power lines over a 12 square block area on the northwest side of the city. The garage of a house also shifted causing roof damage. Oklahoma Mesonet measured wind gusts of 63 mph and 80 mph at 1900 CST and 1905 CST respectively 4 miles southwest of Guthrie in Logan County. Straight-line winds then produced a large swath of damage to mobile homes, house roofs, trees, power poles and power lines in a 4 by 6 mile area across southern Logan County bounded by Western Ave to the west, Interstate 35 to the east, Forest Hills Road to the north, and Waterloo Road to the south. The worst damage occurred in a 1/2 by 1 1/2 mile area near Oak Cliff. Two-hundred fifty residents were damaged. Of these, 10 homes and business building were destroyed, while 41 structures suffered major damage. One hundred sixty-one single family homes, 43 mobile homes, 7 businesses, and 1 apartment complex suffered minor structural damage. Total damage estimates were near 3.5 million dollars. Five persons were injured, consisting mostly of broken fingers and cuts. No one was seriously injured. Lightning also struck an oil tank at Pine and Industrial in Guthrie, starting a fire that was quickly extinguised.Unusually strong straight-line winds also left a swath of damage roughly 8 miles long and 2 miles wide from just east of Jones in eastern Oklahoma County, east-southeast into extreme western Lincoln County 3 miles northeast of Harrah. A two year-old boy was killed, and ten persons were injured, 8 of which were transported to local hospitals. Damage was estimated at about 2 million dollars. Damage was intermittent from east of Jones to north of Horseshoe Lake and was limited mainly to fallen tree limbs. A more persistent area of wind damage about 1.5 miles wide was found from near Luther Road and Wilshire southeast to near the county line and Northeast 50th. Widespread tree damage occurred in this area along with structural damage to several homes. By far the most concentrated area of damage was along a half-mile wide swath from Harrah Road and 63rd extending east-southeast. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed in this area, one of which disintegrated with the frame left wrapped around a tree. All of the destroyed mobile homes were perpendicular to the wind or nearly so and thus were hit broadside by the full force of the wind. The level of damage in this swath is estimated at strong F1 suggesting that maximum winds probably were between 100 and 110 mph.Damage in Lincoln County consisted of downed power lines, uprooted trees, and damaged outbuildings in a half-mile wide by one-mile long swath just north of Highway 62. One barn also disintegrated as it was picked up by the wind and carried nearly one-quarter of a mile. In total, 75 homes were damaged; 11 suffered major damage, and six (All mobile homes) were destroyed. Three mobile homes were found to be totally disintegrated and one other that was rolled from its foundation. Several eyewitness reports indicated that at least some of these mobile homes were airborne while or just before they were destroyed. The fatality, and most of the injuries, were residents who were in the destroyed mobile homes when the winds struck. The last report of damage in Lincoln County occurred in Chandler, where lightning struck numerous transformers and power poles, knocking out power to all of Chandler for 5 hours.Severe thunderstorm winds also downed trees, wires, and numerous power poles all across the city of Edmond in Oklahoma County. Seven thousand residents were left without power for several hours. One tree fell on a car, and the canopy was blown off at Juffy Lube on 2nd Street, east of Bryant. Farther south and east, a tree was blown down near the Mazzio's Pizza on State Highway in Cushing in Payne County; highway signs and numerous trees were downed near Highway 44 in Cleveland County 4 miles west of Moore, and trees and power lines were blown down in Norman, also in Cleveland County. Lightning struck an oil tank battery in Slaughterville in Cleveland County, causing a fire that burned for about 1 hour before being extinguished. A mobile home was blown off its foundation and destroyed in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County. Five persons were inside the home including 3 children who were injured from minor cuts and bruises. The roof was also blown off of a boathouse at Shawnee Lake, also in Pottawatomie County. Numerous Numerous power lines were downed 8 miles east of Pauls Valley in Garvin County knocking out power to 500 residents, while a house sustained significant roof damage from strong winds. Rain poured into the house causing an estimated $20,000 in damage. Power lines and large tree limbs were downed in Wewoka in Seminole County and Holdenville in Hughes County. Lastly, Lightning struck a tree in Sulphur in Murray County, killing 3 cows and an angus bull standing under it.",,PDC

Initially, the surface warm front was located to the south of this system.  That was not actually the case aloft however.  During the predawn hours the surface front surged north and by sunrise was located across northeast Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable to the south of the front with dew point temperatures will in the 70s F.  The initial development of thunderstorms took place during the early part of the day over northeast Nebraska.  The storms became severe quickly as they moved and developed eastward into Iowa.  By mid morning, the storms had formed a nearly east to west line.  Storm relative inflow into the line was around 40 knots.  The storms produced a variety of severe weather across Iowa.  They initially moved east across the northern and central counties, but then began sinking sinking southeast.  The dominant severe weather with the storms was extremely high winds.  Damage was very widespread across the state.  Winds in excess of 100 MPH were reported with one unofficial wind speed measured at 126 MPH in the town of Washington at 1405 CST.  In one unusual story, high winds hit Mahaska County.  Three miles south of New Sharon, a puppy was tied to its dog house which was picked up by the wind.  The dog house and puppy were lifted over the top of a two car garage and a corn crib.  Both were deposited in the farm yard.  When found the dog house was upside down and the puppy, though scared, was fine.  There were several tornadoes during the event.  One of the longer track well defined tornadoes was the initial tornado.  It was on the ground for about 11 miles as it swept across Crawford County.  Several residences, outbuildings, grain bins, and trees were damaged along its path.  Reports indicate that between 30 and 50 residences were damaged by this tornado.  There were several small tornadoes in central Iowa.  They had short tracks and only touched down briefly.  One cut a mile long path east of Marshalltown through a corn field and a grove of trees.  Another in Dallas County was on the ground through mostly open country for two miles.  High winds were a major problem with these storms.  Many places reported winds over 80 MPH with incredible tree damage and numerous buildings damaged or destroyed.  At least 38 counties were declared disaster areas by the Federal Government due to the severe damage and flooding.  A final total will not be available before publication deadlines, however preliminary data have been included.  In the Des Moines County Warning Area these included:  Wright, Franklin, Butler, Bremer, Hamilton, Hardin, Grundy, Crawford, Carroll, Greene, Boone, Story, Marshall,  Audubon, Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Jasper, Cass, Adair, Madison, Warren, Marion, Adams, and Taylor.  One of the hardest hit Counties was Polk County.  Damage appeared to be from straight line winds based on a storm survey that was done following the event.  The damage occurred over the southwest semicircle of a large meso low in contact with the ground.  Due to the rapid translational speed of 50 to 75 MPH, winds were enhanced on the southwest semicircle of the meso low.  Smaller scale winds could have been embedded within this circulation as well.  There was little evidence of small scale convergent tornadic damage, however aerial surveys did make some suggestion and eye witness accounts of sightings were quite numerous in the metro Des Moines area.  All trees and debris were laid down to the south or southeast.  The major damage swath as 3 to 7 miles wide northwest of Camp Dodge, with a widening into a full blown derecho after that.  The event was born a few miles northwest of Perry, between Rippey and Berkley in southwest Boone County.  The mile wide damage path expanded to over 3 miles by the time it reached full intensity near highway 169 between Woodward and Perry.  The path continued through Granger, Camp Dodge, and Johnston.  The path was nearly 7 miles wide near Granger.  A second, smaller, meso low passed near Madrid, downing power lines.  This meso low matured near Jester Park Golf Course, causing significant structural damage to houses.  The two meso lows merged near the NWS Forecast Office in Johnston, with two miles of power poles snapped off between Johnston and Granger.  Much of the damage along the most severe track was in the F1 intensity category, with speeds in the 75 to 110 MPH range.  A few spots along the path, such as in the Granger and Camp Dodge area, sustained sufficient damage to justify F2 winds, 110 to 155 MPH.  It appears a tornado or family of tornadoes touched down southeast of Berkley and moved southeast into the Pleasant Hill area just east of Des Moines.  The track was intermittent, indicating either one tornado touching down occasionally, or one or more weak tornadoes rotating around the meso circulation.  The worst effected metro areas were the Granger area, Johnston, and the northeast side of Des Moines proper.  A duplex in Granger was flattened by the winds.  There were several reports of roofs being ripped off of stores and houses in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Several small private planes were flipped at a small air field north of Des Moines.  There were also several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being blown over on Interstate 35.  Heavy construction equipment was overturned on Interstate 35/80 just north of Des Moines.  Damage was extensive to the east side of Des Moines proper.  To make matters worse, following the passage of the main line of thunderstorms, a second line of severe thunderstorms developed and moved across the same areas already hit.  The storms were smaller, but did produce brief tornado touch downs and hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter.  The second line of storms did eventually combine with the first and moved southeast across the rest of the state.  Damage was widespread across the state and it will be months before final numbers are in.  Estimates from Polk County alone are near $100 million in damage including cleanup.  Totals were still being tallied at this writing, however a few include over $11 million in damage from initial claims in Johnston and $726,000 from West Des Moines just to city buildings and systems.  West Des Moines was on the far west edge of the major damage however.  In addition to the property damage, at least 125 people were injured during the storm.  Most of the injuries were caused by flying debris and many were not serious.  Fortunately there were no fatalities.  Heavy damage was reported by MidAmerica Energy.  On a state wide report, they indicated 200,000 homes  were without electricity, effecting over 500,000 people, at one time during the storm.  In the metropolitan Des Moines area, 100,000 homes were without electricity at the height of the storm.  That number was reduced to around 25,000 36 hours later.  The worst damaged areas were without power for 5 to 6 days.  Heavy damage was also reported by local telephone and cable systems.  In Polk County, the worst damage extended from the Camp Dodge area into the northeast parts of Des Moines.  At least 462 homes in the metro Des Moines area sustained significant damage.  Statewide, 80 homes were destroyed, 559 sustained severe damage, with 1416 others receiving moderate damage.  In the Camp Dodge area, 80 to 90 percent of the brick buildings were damaged with the roofs removed from many of them.  Lightning from the storms struck the WSR-88D in the midst of the storm.  The radar was taken out of service for more than 24 hours because of this.  In addition to the severe weather, flooding quickly became a problem.  Iowa soil was nearly saturated as the weather pattern had been very wet for six weeks previous.  Although rainfall was not extreme, one to three inches of rain fell over a several county area.  This caused widespread urban flooding across north central into central Iowa, though damage from the flooding was not serious.  Crop damage was very difficult to determine and will not likely be clear until the fall harvest.  Reports from some of the local extension agents say damage to the corn ranged up to 75% destroyed in areas with the highest wind, such as the swath that went through central Iowa in association with the tornado there.  No doubt losses will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not in the millions.   Accounts of damage were of course too numerous to document here as the areal extent of the storms was very large.  Countless reports of parts of crop fields being flattened were received.  Semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned by the high winds both in the Des Moines metro area as well as in Newton.  Trees were found on houses over a large part of the state.  One news reported wrote ""there is not a power pole standing between Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa"".  Though not figuratively true, this statement does point out the extensive damage that occurred with these storms.l",,PDC

The first severe thunderstorm to affect eastern Oklahoma scraped the northwestern part of Osage County, causing a report of a severe thunderstorm gust.  This storm quickly died as it entered Kansas.A second more serious severe thunderstorm formed west of Oklahoma City and tracked all the way to the Arkansas state line south of Fort Smith, traversing Pittsburg, Haskell, and Le Flore Counties.  This storm travelled east along an instability axis and a warm front.  From a radar perspective, this storm was impressive in that it kept a classic, well-defined hook on its entire journey across southeast Oklahoma.  From a human perspective, this storm was impressive in that it produced ten tornadoes in southeast Oklahoma, hail as large as golfballs, damaging thunderstorm winds, and torrential flooding rains.A third cluster of severe thunderstorms developed over Creek County and moved east across Okmulgee, Muskogee, Cherokee, and Adair Counties before weakening as it entered Arkansas.  These storms slowed their movement across Muskogee County and regeneration along the southwest flank of the storms caused torrential rainfalls that dumped nearly three inches of rain in northern Muskogee, southern Cherokee, southern Adair, and northern Sequoyah Counties.  In addition to flooding rains, these storms produced hail as large as nickels and damaging thunderstorm winds.",,PDC

This system dragged a warm front across northeastern Pennsylvania.  Behind this front, a southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for the development of severe weather later that afternoon as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From late in the afternoon until late that evening, northeastern Pennsylvania was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, nine separate tornadoes touched down on this day.  Overall damage estimates run into the millions with many homes and structures heavily damaged or destroyed.  The most devastating storms occurred in Pike county.  Within about a 3 hour stretch from 7 to 10 pm EDT, four different twisters affected the county.  One tornadic cell was responsible for knocking down thousands of healthy large trees in and around Promised Land State Park with several vacation homes damaged or leveled.  Fortunately, injuries were kept at a minimum.       Widespread straight line wind damage also occurred with hailstones the size of ping pong balls falling in some places.  The north side of Scranton had extensive wind damage as a storm passed through shortly before 10 pm EDT and sections of Wayne and Luzerne counties had roads closed and/or blocked from falling trees for more than 2 days after the storm.  Pennsylvania Power and Light Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power at the height of the storms on the evening of the 31st.  Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.",A severe thunderstorm became tornadic across extreme southern portions of the county.

Many of these thunderstorms developed rotation with some storms ultimately producing tornadoes.  The first thunderstorms of the day developed over central Oklahoma and then moved eastward toward Okfuskee County after 430 PM CDT, traversing the counties along and just north of I-40 through 730 PM CDT before exiting into Arkansas to the east of Stilwell and Sallisaw.  These thunderstorms produced large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, and two brief tornado touchdowns in Muskogee County.  Other severe thunderstorms developed behind the first cluster, producing severe weather primarily in Creek and Okmulgee Counties from 700 PM to 830 PM CDT.Other severe thunderstorms developed rapidly around 600 PM CDT along a weak cold front across the northern border counties of Oklahoma.  These storms primarily produced large hail.  Further south in southeast Oklahoma, a cap of warm air in the mid-levels of the atmosphere prevented thunderstorm development until around 700 PM CDT with the approach of an upper level disturbance.  Once thunderstorms developed in Pittsburg County, they rapidly became severe and began rotating.  These storms moved east across Haskell and northern Le Flore Counties through 900 PM CDT, producing large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, several brief tornado touchdownsand a tornado producing considerable damage in the small town of Calhoun in northwestern Le Flore County.  At the time of the Calhoun tornado, the WSR-88D near Fort Smith had its first algorithm-induced tornado vortex signature (TVS).",A brief tornado touchdown in Quinton knocked power lines down.  There are no known injuries with this tornado.  The parent storm produced a tornado 4 miles southwest of Quinton just five minutes earlier.,PDC

The tornado began at Nahor Hill and travelled north-northeast about a half mile before ending up just past the Great Brook Elementary School.  Along the middle of its path, a wooded stretch sustained severe tree damage.  Most of the trees were either uprooted or snapped in half...and they fell in different directions.  A small boat was flipped over and a camper-trailer was turned around and flipped over.  A single family home had some shingles torn off.  An apartment complex resident said he saw the metal garbage dumpster rise a short distance while a dark gray-black cloud went by.  At the elementary school, a wall was damaged.

Seven persons were injured (five within Lyons).  About 40 homes were either destroyed or damaged in Lyons, Maiden Creek, Maxatawny and Richmond Townships.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire event were placed at $1.5 million dollars. About 10,250 homes and businesses lost power.  The last homes to come back on line were in Lyons on June 3rd.  This was the first tornado of that strength to occur in Southeast Pennsylvania and the Southern Poconos since the Limerick Tornado on July 27, 1994 and the first F3 tornado to occur within Berks County since November 4, 1950. Even before the tornado formed, the parent thunderstorm was producing wind damage in western Berks County.  Wind damage started in Centre Township as several trailers were overturned in Donny Acres.  In Leesport, the severe thunderstorm ripped the entire roof off one home.  The couple in the house was temporarily trapped after the porch roof they use to access the stairs collapsed.  The thunderstorm also ripped the roof and some bricks off a detached garage.  Other houses and buildings on East Main Street also had some minor wind damage.  Debris from a knitting company's air conditioning unit pelted a neighborhood.  Wind damage also occurred in Ontelaunee Tonship along Pennsylvania State Route 61.The tornado made its initial touchdown just to the east of Lake Ontelaunee in Maiden Creek Township around 9 p.m. EDT and moved almost due east across Richmond Township into the borough of Lyons (about 910 p.m. EDT), across southern Maxatawny Township and lifted in northern Rockland Township and 915 p.m. EDT.   The tornado was on the ground for about 8.3 miles.  Its path width was around 120 yards.The tornado destruction started near U.S. Route 222 in Maiden Creek Township as the roof was blown off one farmhouse.  A vehicle was also crushed by a tree.  In Maxatawny Township six homes were severely damaged.  One house collapsed on Smoketown Road in the Bowers area.   A second house lost its roof in the Arrowhead Development.  The damage increased across Richmond Township as 10 homes or farms were destroyed or damaged.  Pennsylvania State Route 662 was closed between U.S Route 222 and the Fleetwood Borough line because of downed poles and trees.   Parts of U.S. Route 222 were also closed because of debris on the road.   One house completely collapsed.  At one farm the tornado toppled a huge silo and ripped off the roofs of another silo and the barn.  At another home, the remains of a large metal storage bin rested on top of the house.  Golf ball size hail also damaged two vehicles and a metal awning.  The same parent thunderstorm also produced straight line wind damage farther south in Ruscombmanor Township.The worst damage occurred in the borough of Lyons.  The north side of the borough was destroyed.  About one quarter of the borough's 550 residents were affected by the tornado.  The tornado damage within this borough led to a presidential declaration of a disaster area for Berks County.  About 100 residents were sheltered.  The tornado cut a two block wide path along Hunter Street just north of the Conrail Tracks.  About 25 homes were heavily damaged, several collapsed.  Miraculously, only five persons were injured.  The last two tornado related injuries occurred in northern Rockland Township as it lifted and threw a modular home from its foundation.  The two men inside were injured.  The tornado then lifted.Although the tornado lifted, the parent thunderstorm still produced wind damage across eastern Berks County.   Noble Street was closed in Kutztown because of downed trees and lines.  Trees were also uprooted in Longswamp Township.  Downed limbs and wires caused power outages in District, Greenwich, Longswamp and Rockland Townships.",,PDC

The episode was highlighted by supercell thunderstorms which produced three tornadoes, numerous instances of large hail, and several downbursts.The most substantial event was a strong-to-violent tornado which caused excessive damage in western Allegany Co.  The multi-vortex twister had estimated wind speeds of 210 mph - the highest in recorded Maryland history - when it ravaged a neighborhood of well-constructed single-family homes along a local plateau just north of Frostburg.  The tornado was on the ground for an amazing 33 miles, beginning in Somerset Co, Pennsylvania before crossing northeastern Garrett Co Maryland on its way to Allegany Co.  The parent supercell tracked over 200 miles.  After descending Big Savage Mountain, the twister produced a swath of destruction across a neighborhood just west of Frostburg.  At least eight homes were destroyed and dozens others were damaged.  Several cars were damaged, and some were totalled.  One two-story home was obliterated.  Left in the wake was the foundation and some remnant plywood.  The residents of the home - a woman and two children - received ample warning and rode out the storm to safety in the basement.  Advance warning likely saved several lives and reduced casualties; in all, only 5 area residents sustained minor injuries.The tornado continued through Eckhart Mines and Clarysville, causing further damage and destruction to homes and other property.  It then continued through undeveloped areas, then passed across Dans Mountain before damaging a few more residences along state route 53 just north of Cresaptown.  The twister lifted at that point, but the parent thunderstorm continued producing damage into eastern West Virginia.  In all, emergency management officials reported 29 homes destroyed and 125 damaged, with nearly half of the surviving homes receiving moderate to major levels of damage.  Initial dollar estimates ranged from $4.5 to $5 million.  Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of trees in forested and developed areas were snapped or uprooted.  The supercell was so powerful that Frostburg area residents' papers, including personal checks and one high school diploma - were found over 50 miles downstream in the northern Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia.The ""Frostburg Tornado"" was not the only twister to affect the county.  The area had been on high alert since early evening - tornado warnings had been issued two other times, and funnel clouds were observed by several witnesses prior to sunset.  One of the funnels touched down not too far from where the Frostburg Tornado entered the county - along the west side of Big Savage Mountain nearly 2 hours earlier.  The funnel lifted while over Frostburg and nearby communities, and continued through Cumberland before touching down again on Irons Mountain 2-3 miles southeast of the city.  In each instance, damage was limited to forested areas along the ridges.Tornadoes were just a portion of the severe weather to affect northern Maryland.  The other major player was hail, with dozens of occurrences associated with each mini-supercell.  The strongest cells produced hailstones ranging from 1.75"" to 2.50"" in diameter; the strong updrafts in each storm combined with steep atmospheric lapse rates to produce not only large hail but long-duration hail as well.  Some areas experienced up to 20 minutes of  hail, and many residents noted hail which covered the ground.  Reported damage included some stripped siding, varying sized dings and dents, as well as shattered glass,  in numerous vehicles; stripped paint from homes and vehicles, small limb and leaf debris, and likely crop damage or destruction.  The main hail-producing storm affected portions of northern Montgomery, Howard, southern Carroll, southern Baltimore, and northern Prince George's and Anne Arundel Cos - all between 1800 and 1945EST.The episode concluded in Maryland with a few wind damage reports on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay just before midnight.  Winds blew out the door to the Annapolis (Anne Arundel Co) city fire department station, and knocked several large trees down in Eastport at approximately the same time.",,PDC

Three tornadoes were also sighted. Storms first developed in Kay County during the late morning where a semi-truck was blown over 1.5 miles southwest of Blackwell near the intersection of Highway 11 and Interstate 35. Severe thunderstorms then redeveloped over Major and Blaine Counties a few hours later. As these storms moved east into Garfield County, a tornado was spotted 3 miles south of Waukomis moving east. This tornado, rated an F1, knocked down or snapped 40 to 50 power poles, damaged several outbuildings, and destroyed numerous trees. One large diesel storage tank was picked up and desposited one-half mile away. A pickup truck containing 2 occupants was also picked up a short distance from the road and dropped on the side of the road near a creek. Both occupants were uninjured. A semi-trailer was also blown off the highway. As the tornado dissipated, severe thunderstorm winds blew down large tree limbs in Bison, and lightning from the same complex of thunderstorms struck a house in Enid, causing a short in the wiring, which then started a small house fire. Large tree limbs were also downed in Seiling in Dewey County, while a rain gutter from a house was ripped off by the winds 12 miles east of Hennessey in Kingfisher County breaking several flower pots. Large tree limbs were also downed in the same location.As the thunderstorms moved into Logan County, Oklahoma Mesonet measured wind gusts of 59 mph and 66 mph at 1620 CST and 1630 CST respectively 3 miles southeast of Marshall. A weak, F0 tornado was then spotted 9 miles north of Crescent, just west of State Highway 74. The tornado uprooted several trees while crossing the highway, then quickly dissipated. Another weak tornado, an F0, was spotted on the Blaine/Dewey County border 2 miles west of Canton, knocking down trees and power poles. The same thunderstorm was responsible for a lightning strike at the Old Christian Church in Eagle City in Blaine County causing a fire that destroyed the church. As these storms moved east, thunderstorm winds damaged a fence, silo, and several trees in Logan County 3 miles southwest of Langston. Several power poles were blown down 1 mile north of Loyal in Kingfisher County, while in the city of Loyal 13 power poles were snapped, and large tree limbs were blown down. Widespread wind damage occurred in the city of Kingfisher consisting of downed trees and power lines over a 12 square block area on the northwest side of the city. The garage of a house also shifted causing roof damage. Oklahoma Mesonet measured wind gusts of 63 mph and 80 mph at 1900 CST and 1905 CST respectively 4 miles southwest of Guthrie in Logan County. Straight-line winds then produced a large swath of damage to mobile homes, house roofs, trees, power poles and power lines in a 4 by 6 mile area across southern Logan County bounded by Western Ave to the west, Interstate 35 to the east, Forest Hills Road to the north, and Waterloo Road to the south. The worst damage occurred in a 1/2 by 1 1/2 mile area near Oak Cliff. Two-hundred fifty residents were damaged. Of these, 10 homes and business building were destroyed, while 41 structures suffered major damage. One hundred sixty-one single family homes, 43 mobile homes, 7 businesses, and 1 apartment complex suffered minor structural damage. Total damage estimates were near 3.5 million dollars. Five persons were injured, consisting mostly of broken fingers and cuts. No one was seriously injured. Lightning also struck an oil tank at Pine and Industrial in Guthrie, starting a fire that was quickly extinguised.Unusually strong straight-line winds also left a swath of damage roughly 8 miles long and 2 miles wide from just east of Jones in eastern Oklahoma County, east-southeast into extreme western Lincoln County 3 miles northeast of Harrah. A two year-old boy was killed, and ten persons were injured, 8 of which were transported to local hospitals. Damage was estimated at about 2 million dollars. Damage was intermittent from east of Jones to north of Horseshoe Lake and was limited mainly to fallen tree limbs. A more persistent area of wind damage about 1.5 miles wide was found from near Luther Road and Wilshire southeast to near the county line and Northeast 50th. Widespread tree damage occurred in this area along with structural damage to several homes. By far the most concentrated area of damage was along a half-mile wide swath from Harrah Road and 63rd extending east-southeast. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed in this area, one of which disintegrated with the frame left wrapped around a tree. All of the destroyed mobile homes were perpendicular to the wind or nearly so and thus were hit broadside by the full force of the wind. The level of damage in this swath is estimated at strong F1 suggesting that maximum winds probably were between 100 and 110 mph.Damage in Lincoln County consisted of downed power lines, uprooted trees, and damaged outbuildings in a half-mile wide by one-mile long swath just north of Highway 62. One barn also disintegrated as it was picked up by the wind and carried nearly one-quarter of a mile. In total, 75 homes were damaged; 11 suffered major damage, and six (All mobile homes) were destroyed. Three mobile homes were found to be totally disintegrated and one other that was rolled from its foundation. Several eyewitness reports indicated that at least some of these mobile homes were airborne while or just before they were destroyed. The fatality, and most of the injuries, were residents who were in the destroyed mobile homes when the winds struck. The last report of damage in Lincoln County occurred in Chandler, where lightning struck numerous transformers and power poles, knocking out power to all of Chandler for 5 hours.Severe thunderstorm winds also downed trees, wires, and numerous power poles all across the city of Edmond in Oklahoma County. Seven thousand residents were left without power for several hours. One tree fell on a car, and the canopy was blown off at Juffy Lube on 2nd Street, east of Bryant. Farther south and east, a tree was blown down near the Mazzio's Pizza on State Highway in Cushing in Payne County; highway signs and numerous trees were downed near Highway 44 in Cleveland County 4 miles west of Moore, and trees and power lines were blown down in Norman, also in Cleveland County. Lightning struck an oil tank battery in Slaughterville in Cleveland County, causing a fire that burned for about 1 hour before being extinguished. A mobile home was blown off its foundation and destroyed in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County. Five persons were inside the home including 3 children who were injured from minor cuts and bruises. The roof was also blown off of a boathouse at Shawnee Lake, also in Pottawatomie County. Numerous Numerous power lines were downed 8 miles east of Pauls Valley in Garvin County knocking out power to 500 residents, while a house sustained significant roof damage from strong winds. Rain poured into the house causing an estimated $20,000 in damage. Power lines and large tree limbs were downed in Wewoka in Seminole County and Holdenville in Hughes County. Lastly, Lightning struck a tree in Sulphur in Murray County, killing 3 cows and an angus bull standing under it.",,PDC

Strong upper level dynamics moved over the state over the top of an unstable air mass.  Surface dew point temperatures were in the low 70s with actual temperatures in the upper 70s to low 80s.  CAPE values rose to between 2500 and 3500 J/kg.  The situation became complex during the afternoon as several bands of severe thunderstorms developed.  Some areas of the state were affected three times during the day as the storms raced northeast around 60 MPH.  The main severe feature with the storms was high wind.  There were numerous reports of wind gusts of 60 to 75 MPH.  Some were even higher.  One of the highest reports came from Atlantic in Cass County.  Ninety one MPH winds there threw several cars and a few semi-tractortrailer trucks off of Interstate 80.  High winds in Kossuth County at Algona resulted in roof damage at a nursing home there.  Part of the roof was removed by the winds with the damage estimates to the building places at around $200,000.  Another cluster of storms moved into north central Iowa and caused widespread damage in Cerro Gordo and Worth Counties.  Both were hit with winds around 70 MPH.  There were numerous other reports of damage to farm buildings around the state ranging from corn cribs damaged to barns being destroyed.  Damage to trees and power lines was extensive.  North of Algona, along U.S. Highway 169, seventy eight power poles were downed by the high winds resulting in a four day closure of the highway.  Utility damage around the county was estimated at between $600,000 and $800,000, while insurance adjusters estimated damage around the county at $1.2 million.  There were some reports of hail, especially during the first few hours of the event.  The largest hail was around golf ball in size.  In addition to the wind and hail, there were several tornado touch downs in the state.  A tornado touched down in Kossuth County and did over $1 million in damage.  The tornado destroyed 2 houses with another 10 sustaining major damage.  Fifteen farmsteads were destroyed as well.  Kossuth County was later declared a disaster area.  There was also considerable damage to barns and other farm buildings across the county.  The outflow from the tornadic storm in Kossuth County pushed an 85 MPH wind gust south into Humboldt County.  The high winds blew over 41 railroad cars of the Union Pacific Railroad south of Ottosen.  A band of 80 to 90 MPH winds swept across Franklin and Butler Counties.  Damage was widespread.  There was one report of the wind carrying the family dog over one half mile from home.  The dog was later found safe and healthy.  Another of the stronger tornadoes included one in Wright County that was on the ground for over 10 miles.  It damaged several farm buildings along its path.  Several 2 x 4's were driven into the ground north of Clarion by the tornado.  Another fairly strong tornado touched down in Crawford County.  The rope tornado touched down southeast of Denison.  It hit a train about 3 miles east of Denison and derailed nine cars of the Union Pacific freight train.  The engineer saw it coming and thought it was so small that nothing would happen.  There was also minor damage to 1 house and several out buildings.  There were a few other brief touch downs around the state, however no damage was reported with them.   The rapid movement of the storms prevented a lot of the flooding that would have otherwise occurred.  Repeat thunderstorms passing over Kossuth County did cause some urban flooding.  Damage was relatively minor, however several homes reported minor flooding.  As the storms moved across Hancock County, lightning struck a house in the town of Britt.  The kitchen sink was blown away from the wall and all of the appliances and the electrical equipment in the house was damaged.  Lightning struck very close to another house in Wright County in Belmond.  A 75-year old woman received minor injuries as she was struck by lightning as she unplugged her TV near a large window.",Intermittent track,PDC

This set the stage for a major severe weather outbreak in eastern New York.  In this highly sheared environment several lines of severe thunderstorms formed ahead of an approaching cold front.  This resulted in three tornadoes and severe thunderstorm damage in every county.   The most significant tornado occurred in Saratoga County and northern Rensselaer County.  This tornado touched down at Ushers Road in the Town of Halfmoon and moved due east into the City of Mechanicville.  Here, the tornado intensified to an F3 and destroyed the DiSiena Furniture Company.  The tornado tracked over Viall Hill where several housing developments were devastated.  It continued east into the Riverside area in the Town of Stillwater, where many homes, businesses and several warehouses including De Crescente Distributing Company were destroyed or heavily damaged.  The tornado then crossed the Hudson River into Rensselaer County and decreased to an F2.  The tornado tracked across the Town of Schaghticoke and just brushed the Village of Schaghticoke to the north.  Czub Grain Farm on Verbeck Avenue was heavily damaged.  It then followed the Hoosic River as it crossed the Village of Valley Falls and into the northern portion of the Town of Pittstown to Millertown.  At this point the track became discontinuous and the intensity decreased to an F1.  In the Town of Hoosick the path became continuous again and increased to an F2.  Several farms received extensive damage including Lukeland Dairy Farm where a 60 ton silo and barn were leveled.  The tornado then tracked from extreme northeast Rensselaer County to Bennington County in southern Vermont where it quickly decreased to an F1 after crossing the border.  Governor Pataki declared a State of Emergency in Saratoga and Rensselaer Counties.  The National Guard was called in by the Governor to assist in the clean up.  In Saratoga County approximately 55 homes were destroyed and 230 were damaged.  In Rensselaer County approximately 50 to 60 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.  Power was not restored to parts of this region for three to four days.  Approximately 70 injuries occurred with this tornado but no one was killed.  Another tornado tracked across southern Rensselaer County.  This tornado first touched down on Palmer Road about two miles east of Interstate 90 in the Town of Schodack.  The tornado moved due east and passed just south of North Schodack then tracked east northeast to Millers Corners on the south shore of Burden Lake.  The damage path continued in this direction to Pike Pond before it dissipated at Alps Mountain.  This tornado destroyed three barns, damaged several homes and produced extensive tree damage along its path.  The last tornado tracked across the Albany International Airport.  It began southwest of the airport about one-half mile west of Memory Gardens Cemetery.  The damage path continued east northeast to the Albany ASOS unit where an 82 mile an hour gust was reported.  Next it tracked near the Air National Guard facility at the Albany Airport before it crossed Interstate 87 and dissipated.  The most widespread damage occurred near the Hilton Hotel where several trees were uprooted or sheared off.   At Easton in Washington County, a microburst producing winds of 100 miles an hour took the roof off the fire house and leveled a barn after it was carried 60 yards.  South of the Village of Herkimer in Herkimer County, a powerful downburst took the roof off a T hangar at a small private airport and damaged two airplanes.  A couple of out buildings and a small trailer office were also rolled off their foundations.  The severe weather caused widespread power outages across all of eastern New York.  The damaging winds downed power lines, power poles and trees in many locations.  Structural damage occurred to several homes and garages due to downed trees.  Damage to crops was also quite extensive especially in the mid Hudson Valley and Capital District.

The strongest tornado, an F3, occurred near Lamont in Grant County. There were also reports of hail up to 3.5 inches in diameter, straight line wind damage, and flooding. The first tornado, an F0, touched down in an open field 1 mile south of Amorita in Alfalfa County at 1745 CST lasting for less than one minute with no reports of damage. The second tornado, also an F0, was reported 5 minutes later by media chasers to have touched down in an open field 3 miles east northeast of Amorita. Touchdown was very brief with no damage reported. The third tornado was also observed by media chasers, this time in northeast Alfalfa County 8 miles east of Amorita. The tornado, an F1, damaged one house and knocked down power lines as it moved southeast and weakened while crossing into western Grant County for a total damage path lengh of 5 miles. There were no reports of damage with this segment of the tornado in Grant County and thus was rated an F0. An unusual aspect of this tornado was that it was reported to be rotating anticyclonically. The fourth and fifth tornadoes were also rated F0, the fourth reported by media chasers to have touched down in an open field 4 west northwest of Wakita with no damage, and the fifth observed by Wakita Fire Department to be on the ground for 2.5 miles from 2 miles southwest of Wakita to 2 miles south of Wakita. No damage was reported. An off-duty National Weather Service meteorologist observed the sixth tornado, an F0, in an open field 9 miles west of Medford. The seventh tornado, also an F0, produced no damage as it rotated anticyclonically 3 miles southeast of Wakita. The eighth and ninth tornadoes, both F0, occurred simultaneously 6 miles west of Medford. The eighth tornado touched down just north of Highway 11 while the ninth tornado touched down just south of Highway 11.

The eleventh tornado, an F0, was observed by an off duty National Weather Service meteorologist to be knocking down trees and power lines in a 5 mile long damage path in southern Grant County. The twelvth tornado, an F1, snapped trees in half and damaged a private airstrip 4 miles east northeast of Pond Creek while the thirteenth tornado, also an F1, damaged several homes and knocked down trees and power lines 1 mile north of Salt Fork. The fourteenth tornado, an F0, was reported by spotters to have touched down briefly in an open field causing no damage.                          The most destructive tornado occurred near the city of Lamont where damage estimates reached 2 million dollars.  National Weather Service meteorologists conducted a survey of the area and found a damage path 5 1/4 miles long and 3/4 of a mile wide with F3 damage occurring 2 miles west of Lamont where a well-built brick home had all of its exterior walls destroyed. In addition, 6 single-family homes were destroyed 1.5 miles south of Lamont, while in the city of Lamont 3 single-family dwellings sustained major damage. Nine single-family homes sufferred minor damage. Nearly a dozen vehicles were destroyed, including automobiles, pickup trucks, farm trucks, and farm tractors. Several barns were destroyed including one barn where 30 sheep were also killed. More than 70 utility poles were ripped down in a 3 mile stretch. The Lamont tornado, as it is referred, was unusual in its direction of movement. Several eye witnesses reported a southeast to northwest movement. WSR-88D data also showed the mesocyclone associated with the tornado moving from south to north in a looping manner when the tornado was reported. The last tornado, the sixteenth of this episode, touched down briefly in an open field 5 miles northwest of Tonkawa at 2130 CST. Tonkawa Emergency Management reported no damage. Thus, this tornado was rated an F0.    In addition to these tornadoes, a large macroburst containing damaging straight-line winds occurred from 13 miles west of Medford (Grant County) to 4 miles west northwest of Pond Creek. Satellite dishes owned by Classic Cable Company, which were rated at 110 mph, were flattened by the winds. Straight-line wind damage was also reported in Alva where one man sustained minor injuries when he was blown into the bed of a pickup truck. Also in Alva at least 3 mobile homes suffered major damage; several carports were destroyed; awning and minor roof damage occurred to many homes; and trees and power lines were blown down. One indirect fatality occurred in Alva when a man slipped and suffered a heart attack while seeking shelter in a storm cellar. Other reports of straight-line wind damage include major roof damage to an old schoolhouse gymnasium in the city of Jefferson in Grant County. Two large cedar trees were also uprooted in Jefferson. A tree limb was blown through a picture window 14 miles north northeast of Camp Houston in Woods County. Windows were also blown out of a shed, and numerous trees were downed. Four to six inch tree limbs were blown down 9 miles west of Cherokee in Alfalfa County.  In Thomas in Custer County one utility pole was snapped and large limbs were blown down. Power lines were knocked down in Edmond in Oklahoma County. Severe winds also damaged the roof of the Fred Humphrey Pavillion in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County. The largest hail reported measured 3.5 inches in diameter and occurred in Medford in Grant County. Three reported events of at least tennis ball size hail occurred in Goltry (Alfalfa County) in less than 2 hours: tennis ball size hail at 2140 CST and 2230 CST, and baseball size hail at 2305 CST. Between 30 and 100 percent of the wheat crop was destroyed due to large hail from about 2 miles west of Jet to near Goltry. Another area south of Cherokee, near the junction of US 64 and SH 8 also sustained major wheat crop damage. In addition numerous vehicles had their windows broken. Tennis ball size hail also damaged the wheat crop and numerous vehicles in Okarche in Canadian County while in Watonga in Blaine County golf ball size hail damaged RV vehicles and street lights. Quarter size hail damaged several vehicles 6 miles north of Piedmont in Canadian County. Lightning struck a house in Piedmont causing a house to catch on fire. The last of the severe thunderstorms moved through northern Oklahoma during the early morning of May 25th, resulting in flooding near Cherokee and the National Wildlife Refuge in Alfalfa County, where 5.5 inches of rain fell.

The most significant storm developed in Washita county at approximately 400 pm CST and intensified as it moved east toward central Oklahoma.  This storm produced at least six tornadoes as it tracked from Canadian County across Oklahoma County during the early evening. The most damaging tornado (an F2)  touched down in northeast Oklahoma City and crossed Interstate 35 near the Frontier City theme park. Other tornadoes damaged the Oklahoma City Boat Club, portions of The Village and Nichols Hills, the Highland Park neighborhood west of Broadway Extension, and the area near May and Grand Avenues in Oklahoma City. Three weak tornadoes also touched down in open country northwest of El Reno and near Yukon. In addition to damaging tornadoes, the storm produced extensive straight-line wind damage from Lake Hefner, across Nichols Hills and The Village, into northeast Oklahoma County. Winds likely exceeded 100 mph in some areas. There were no fatalities and only 21 relatively minor injuries reported in Oklahoma County. The majority of the injuries were sustained at the Frontier City theme park. Earlier, another supercell thunderstorm produced tornadoes near Longdale in Blaine County and 3 miles southwest of Guthrie.  Supercells that tracked across Noble County and northern Cleveland County produced large hail and severe winds, but no tornadoes.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.","This tornado touched down as a waterspout over Lake Hefner and moved east to dissipate between May Avenue and Lake Hefner Parkway. Total path length was approximately 3/4 mile and its width was approximately 50 yards.

These thunderstorms produced large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, and two brief tornado touchdowns in Muskogee County.  Other severe thunderstorms developed behind the first cluster, producing severe weather primarily in Creek and Okmulgee Counties from 700 PM to 830 PM CDT.Other severe thunderstorms developed rapidly around 600 PM CDT along a weak cold front across the northern border counties of Oklahoma.  These storms primarily produced large hail.  Further south in southeast Oklahoma, a cap of warm air in the mid-levels of the atmosphere prevented thunderstorm development until around 700 PM CDT with the approach of an upper level disturbance.  Once thunderstorms developed in Pittsburg County, they rapidly became severe and began rotating.  These storms moved east across Haskell and northern Le Flore Counties through 900 PM CDT, producing large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, several brief tornado touchdownsand a tornado producing considerable damage in the small town of Calhoun in northwestern Le Flore County.

The combustible situation produced a mesoscale low pressure system which focused the most substantial severe which focused the most substantial severe weather in north-central Maryland.   The episode featured five tornadoes, nearly a dozen instances of wind damage, and several large hail occurrences.The most concentrated damage was in and around Hagerstown.  Three separate tornadoes dropped from the same parent thunderstorm within moments of each other.  The first two caused considerable property damage between the town of Halfway and Hagerstown.  The third produced a track of mainly tree and underbrush damage from just south of the Washington County Regional Airport to the Maryland/Pennsylvania state line.  The first twister, which developed three miles south of Halfway, toppled and uprooted dozens of trees and blew down wires in the Tammany Manor neighborhood, as well as at the Hickory Elementary School.  The tornado saved its worst for the Valley Mall, where a portion of the roof was torn off and damage was noted at an anchor store's loading dock.  Another adjacent store had an electrical fire.More commercial damage occurred a few blocks north, along Wesel Boulevard, where the roofs of several vacant buildings were torn off.  Canopy tents at the Wal-Mart department store were flattened; the store's garden center had its greenhouse destroyed; many pieces of equipment, and plants and flowers, were also damaged.  An awning at a local automobile dealership was ripped off.  This tornado dissipated just southeast of the Washington Co. Detention Center - but not before knocking down trees along Interstate 81, temporarily closing one of the two travel lanes.Shortly before the first tornado lifted, a second touched down in the Greenbury Hills subdivision of Halfway, uprooting trees and ripping siding from a few homes.  This twister, on the ground for five miles, caused much of its damage over the western portion of Hagerstown before dissipating.  At the Potomac Center, 44 trees were uprooted, and another 40 were damaged.  Dozens more were snapped and uprooted at the nearby Carroll Heights/Hyde Park subdivision; trees were also uprooted and snapped at the Rest Haven Cemetery, with at least four fallen trees knocking over headstones.  Hundreds more trees were damaged at both the Hagerstown Business College and the nearby Fountain Head Country Club, whose golf course was closed for two days to clean up the debris.While eastern Washington Co was being pummelled, another cell was producing wind damage from southwestern through central Frederick Co.  Several trees were snapped and uprooted, and some homes sustained damage to shingles, siding, and porch supports, in Middletown.  More damage was noted between Jefferson and Buckeystown - another microburst - witnessed by residents as a rolling black cloud.  Damage included numerous trees snapped and uprooted, a destroyed cinder block outbuilding, and a damaged garage door.  Farther to the northeast, more trees were snapped, including one which fell onto a house near Libertytown.  A small tornado touched down just northeast of Frederick city, taking down about a half-dozen trees near the intersection of Gas House and Linganore Roads.  Intense lightning caused problems as well.  The radio transmission tower which serves the Frederick Co emergency operations center was knocked out, with damage reported to radio and telecommunications equipment.  Several homes were struck in the area, as was a fire department vehicle.Severe weather propagated eastward into Carroll and Baltimore Cos.  Damaging winds snapped and uprooted many trees in Westminster, including one which fell onto a home.  Two trees crashed through residents' roofs along state route 31 near Westminster.  Large hail the size of tennis balls caused scattered damage to homes and vehicles in Finksburg.  The heavy rains associated with the stronger cells caused flash flooding across portions of the Big Pipe Creek watershed in northern Carroll Co; several roads were temporarily closed near Taneytown where the Bear Branch overflowed its banks.  One road was washed out.  Lightning struck at least one home and barn, causing small fires and minor damage.Just west of the Baltimore/Carroll line (1 mile southwest of Fowblesburg), a small tornado knocked down several trees, some which fell onto a house, a camper, and a shed.  Sheet metal was stripped from the shed; the trees were severely twisted, according to the resident.  More trees or large limbs fell in Reisterstown (Baltimore Co) and in northern Howard Co.As events were winding down across northern Maryland, another severe storm moved out of east-central Virginia and into lower southern Maryland, causing damage in counties that had been struck the previous evening.  Trees and large limbs fell across portions of northern and eastern Charles Co, but the storm apparently saved its worst for St Mary's Co, where three barns were destroyed and numerous trees were snapped or uprooted along the state route(s) 239/520 corridor near Milestown.  In Calvert Co, more trees/large limbs fell, and a portion of roof and some siding were stripped from one home.Thousands of Maryland residents lost power yet again due to the storms; a total of at least 25,000 customers in the Baltimore Gas and Electric and Allegheny Power service areas had no electricity during the height of the storm.",,PDC

A strong downburst took place in eastern Tuscola County, where a horse barn was leveled, trees were uprooted, siding of a nearby house and garage was damaged, and a children's swing set was wrapped around a tree.  The same decaying storm moved into Evergreen Township in Sanilac County, where it heavily damaged a barn and tore the roofing off of a shed.  An isolated storm behind this band produced some dime-sized hail in Lapeer.The southernmost storm of this band would become the most potent storm of the day.  It acquired supercell characteristics as it moved east across Sanilac County.  This storm first caused damage when it downed trees southeast of Sandusky.  Rotation in the storm continued to intensify, and a tornado formed between Carsonville and Applegate - the first tornado in Sanilac County since September 2, 1984.  The tornado had a continual damage path from its first touchdown until it moved out over Lake Huron at Port Sanilac.  Ping-pong to golfball-sized hail preceded the tornado by a few minutes from Carsonville to Port Sanilac.  Four homes, ten barns, five silos, and a grain bin were destroyed.  Twelve homes and six barns were damaged.  Significant damage was done to the public marina in Port Sanilac.  Two hundred people were left without power overnight.  There were no human casualties, but a horse had to be euthanised after it was seriously injured.The supercell storm put out an outflow boundary, and an isolated severe thunderstorm developed along this boundary after the supercell had moved out over the open lake.  This last severe storm produced large hail along the St. Clair - Sanilac county line.",,PDC

In Glasgow of Barren county, a 67 year old man was killed in his mobile home and a 47 year old man was killed by flying debris off his greenhouse. The Glasgow area of Barren county and the Pellyton area of Adair county were hardest hit sustaining F3 damage. In Glasgow, 1 house was destroyed and 45 were badly damaged. 35 mobile homes and 25 barns were also badly damaged or destroyed. Winds were estimated at around 175 mph in the Glasgow area. Another wide area area of severe destruction took place across northern Adair county from around Portland to Pellyton. There, 14 houses were destroyed or received major damage. 3 mobile homes and 27 barns were also destroyed. 146 homes and 50 barns were damaged or destroyed across Barren county, while 30 homes, 84 barns, 2 schools and 8 businesses were damaged or destroyed across Adair county. Metcalfe county also sustained minimal damage to 19 structures, major damage to 43 and destruction to 54. F2 damage was estimated across much of Metcalfe county. Many eyewitnesses across the affected counties reported two smaller sub-vortices within the parent funnels. After reviewing Doppler radar reflectivity patterns and damage patterns, it appears the first tornado moved from northern Logan county to the Barren-Metcalfe county line. Then another formed in the near Wisdom in Metcalfe county before it dissipated 2 miles east of Edmonton.

This small F1 tornado broke out windows, lifted a car off the ground, tore the roof off a house, damaged several mobile homes and toppled trees. The second tornado developed one mile southwest of Mayodan around 325 PM EST and traveled to the northeast about 12 miles before dissipating about three miles northwest of Eden around 349 PM EST. This rather large F3 tornado damaged or destroyed 500 to 600 residences and damaged or destroyed nearly all businesses in Stoneville and some businesses in Mayodan. This tornado tossed a truck 60 feet, carried a cinder block and an empty boat trailer about a quarter mile and pushed a 25,000 pound fire truck about 60 feet. The tornado knocked out a 300 foot section of a wall and severely damaged the roof from a large building in Mayodan. Damage to this building was estimated at 25 million dollars. The tornado was generally 100 to 400 yards wide, but in one place was around 800 yards wide. Two people lost their lives and officially 27 were injured. The fatalities included an 80 year old man who was pulled from his house southwest of Stoneville and tossed 500 feet in the air and a 24 year old woman who was in her car in Stoneville when the tornado hit. The tornado tossed her car into a building and then the wall of the building collapsed on the car. There were likely another 10 to 20 injuries that were unreported as people drove themselves to the hospital or were driven by friends. Cancelled checks and papers from Stoneville were found 53 miles north-northeast in Huddleston, Virginia.

This set the stage for the development of severe weather later that afternoon as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From late in the afternoon until late that evening, northeastern Pennsylvania was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, nine separate tornadoes touched down on this day.  Overall damage estimates run into the millions with many homes and structures heavily damaged or destroyed.  The most devastating storms occurred in Pike county.  Within about a 3 hour stretch from 7 to 10 pm EDT, four different twisters affected the county.  One tornadic cell was responsible for knocking down thousands of healthy large trees in and around Promised Land State Park with several vacation homes damaged or leveled.

Many of these thunderstorms developed rotation with some storms ultimately producing tornadoes.  The first thunderstorms of the day developed over central Oklahoma and then moved eastward toward Okfuskee County after 430 PM CDT, traversing the counties along and just north of I-40 through 730 PM CDT before exiting into Arkansas to the east of Stilwell and Sallisaw.  These thunderstorms produced large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, and two brief tornado touchdowns in Muskogee County.  Other severe thunderstorms developed behind the first cluster, producing severe weather primarily in Creek and Okmulgee Counties from 700 PM to 830 PM CDT.Other severe thunderstorms developed rapidly around 600 PM CDT along a weak cold front across the northern border counties of Oklahoma.  These storms primarily produced large hail.  Further south in southeast Oklahoma, a cap of warm air in the mid-levels of the atmosphere prevented thunderstorm development until around 700 PM CDT with the approach of an upper level disturbance.  Once thunderstorms developed in Pittsburg County, they rapidly became severe and began rotating.  These storms moved east across Haskell and northern Le Flore Counties through 900 PM CDT, producing large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, several brief tornado touchdownsand a tornado producing considerable damage in the small town of Calhoun in northwestern Le Flore County.  At the time of the Calhoun tornado, the WSR-88D near Fort Smith had its first algorithm-induced tornado vortex signature (TVS).",Emergency management director reported a tornado 4 miles southwest of Quinton.

The snow began falling around noon on the twelfth and continued off and on through the thirteenth.  Thunder and lightning accompanied some of the heavier ice-pellet and snow showers, and the weight of the snow snapped tree branches, resulting in isolated power outages.  Snow was reported as low as 4000 feet, with heavy accumulations above 6000 feet.  Reported amounts ranged from around six inches at 5800 feet, to two feet above 8000 feet.  The heavy snow prompted the reopening of some ski resorts.  For one resort, it was the first time in it's 74 year history that it had been open so late in the season.  The cold weather made it particularly difficult  for undocumented immigrants travelling through the Laguna Mountains where wind-swept rain and snow fell.  One 29 year-old man died of hypothermia on Mount Laguna.  Convection in the cold air  produced thunderstorms with locally heavy downpours of rain and gusty winds over the Inland Empire.  Reports of funnel clouds were received from pilots and observers near March Air Force Base, and Homeland.  One of the funnel clouds apparently touched down as a weak tornado in the Highland Palms mobile home park in Homeland ripping awnings from several trailers.

The tornado continued northeast, widened to 250 yards and intensified to F2 strength where it destroyed or severely damaged several structures along Doherty Drive.Two mobile homes that took a direct hit from the F2 tornado along Doherty Drive were completely disintegrated with only frame rails and tie downs intact.  Meanwhile, in close proximity to the crushed mobile homes, a well-built home, with rebar-poured concrete, reinforced cinder block walls and a hip roof, suffered minor structural and roofing tile damage after taking a direct hit by the F2 tornado on Doherty Drive.  A pick-up truck parked adjacent to the well-built home was pushed 30 feet from its original resting place by the tornadic wind.Residents along Doherty Drive reported the sound of the tornado resembled that of a large freight train.  One severely injured resident on Doherty Drive was tossed over 50 feet into the street from his mobile home that was destroyed by the tornado.A storage facility with unsupported cinder block walls and a high unsupported roof span was demolished by the tornadic wind.  Tornado ground survey indicated that a large ten foot plus wide wood door entrance failed and allowed the tornadic wind to enter the commercial structure and exert extreme pressure on the outer load bearing walls which collapsed outward.Aerial survey indicated that the tornado weakened to F1 strength and continued northeast across rural pasture and semi-wooded swampland where it caused severe damage to a few mobile homes, barns, fences and sheds before it crossed State Road 60, one quarter mile west of Tiger Lake Road, or 11.5 miles east of Lake Wales.The tornado downed large power lines along State Road 60 and continued northeast where it snapped tree tops and branches before it lifted and dissipated along the southwest shore of Lake Kissimmee.The tornado in all destroyed or severely damaged twelve homes, caused moderate to slight damage to an additional fourteen homes, severely damaged four commercial buildings and damaged two recreational vehicles.  The tornado also snapped several large power poles, downed numerous power lines and uprooted or snapped several large trees.

Initially, the surface warm front was located to the south of this system.  That was not actually the case aloft however.  During the predawn hours the surface front surged north and by sunrise was located across northeast Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable to the south of the front with dew point temperatures will in the 70s F.  The initial development of thunderstorms took place during the early part of the day over northeast Nebraska.  The storms became severe quickly as they moved and developed eastward into Iowa.  By mid morning, the storms had formed a nearly east to west line.  Storm relative inflow into the line was around 40 knots.  The storms produced a variety of severe weather across Iowa.  They initially moved east across the northern and central counties, but then began sinking sinking southeast.  The dominant severe weather with the storms was extremely high winds.  Damage was very widespread across the state.  Winds in excess of 100 MPH were reported with one unofficial wind speed measured at 126 MPH in the town of Washington at 1405 CST.  In one unusual story, high winds hit Mahaska County.  Three miles south of New Sharon, a puppy was tied to its dog house which was picked up by the wind.  The dog house and puppy were lifted over the top of a two car garage and a corn crib.  Both were deposited in the farm yard.  When found the dog house was upside down and the puppy, though scared, was fine.  There were several tornadoes during the event.  One of the longer track well defined tornadoes was the initial tornado.  It was on the ground for about 11 miles as it swept across Crawford County.  Several residences, outbuildings, grain bins, and trees were damaged along its path.  Reports indicate that between 30 and 50 residences were damaged by this tornado.  There were several small tornadoes in central Iowa.  They had short tracks and only touched down briefly.  One cut a mile long path east of Marshalltown through a corn field and a grove of trees.  Another in Dallas County was on the ground through mostly open country for two miles.  High winds were a major problem with these storms.  Many places reported winds over 80 MPH with incredible tree damage and numerous buildings damaged or destroyed.  At least 38 counties were declared disaster areas by the Federal Government due to the severe damage and flooding.  A final total will not be available before publication deadlines, however preliminary data have been included.  In the Des Moines County Warning Area these included:  Wright, Franklin, Butler, Bremer, Hamilton, Hardin, Grundy, Crawford, Carroll, Greene, Boone, Story, Marshall,  Audubon, Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Jasper, Cass, Adair, Madison, Warren, Marion, Adams, and Taylor.  One of the hardest hit Counties was Polk County.  Damage appeared to be from straight line winds based on a storm survey that was done following the event.  The damage occurred over the southwest semicircle of a large meso low in contact with the ground.  Due to the rapid translational speed of 50 to 75 MPH, winds were enhanced on the southwest semicircle of the meso low.  Smaller scale winds could have been embedded within this circulation as well.  There was little evidence of small scale convergent tornadic damage, however aerial surveys did make some suggestion and eye witness accounts of sightings were quite numerous in the metro Des Moines area.  All trees and debris were laid down to the south or southeast.  The major damage swath as 3 to 7 miles wide northwest of Camp Dodge, with a widening into a full blown derecho after that.  The event was born a few miles northwest of Perry, between Rippey and Berkley in southwest Boone County.  The mile wide damage path expanded to over 3 miles by the time it reached full intensity near highway 169 between Woodward and Perry.  The path continued through Granger, Camp Dodge, and Johnston.  The path was nearly 7 miles wide near Granger.  A second, smaller, meso low passed near Madrid, downing power lines.  This meso low matured near Jester Park Golf Course, causing significant structural damage to houses.  The two meso lows merged near the NWS Forecast Office in Johnston, with two miles of power poles snapped off between Johnston and Granger.  Much of the damage along the most severe track was in the F1 intensity category, with speeds in the 75 to 110 MPH range.  A few spots along the path, such as in the Granger and Camp Dodge area, sustained sufficient damage to justify F2 winds, 110 to 155 MPH.  It appears a tornado or family of tornadoes touched down southeast of Berkley and moved southeast into the Pleasant Hill area just east of Des Moines.  The track was intermittent, indicating either one tornado touching down occasionally, or one or more weak tornadoes rotating around the meso circulation.  The worst effected metro areas were the Granger area, Johnston, and the northeast side of Des Moines proper.  A duplex in Granger was flattened by the winds.  There were several reports of roofs being ripped off of stores and houses in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Several small private planes were flipped at a small air field north of Des Moines.  There were also several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being blown over on Interstate 35.  Heavy construction equipment was overturned on Interstate 35/80 just north of Des Moines.  Damage was extensive to the east side of Des Moines proper.  To make matters worse, following the passage of the main line of thunderstorms, a second line of severe thunderstorms developed and moved across the same areas already hit.  The storms were smaller, but did produce brief tornado touch downs and hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter.  The second line of storms did eventually combine with the first and moved southeast across the rest of the state.  Damage was widespread across the state and it will be months before final numbers are in.  Estimates from Polk County alone are near $100 million in damage including cleanup.  Totals were still being tallied at this writing, however a few include over $11 million in damage from initial claims in Johnston and $726,000 from West Des Moines just to city buildings and systems.  West Des Moines was on the far west edge of the major damage however.  In addition to the property damage, at least 125 people were injured during the storm.  Most of the injuries were caused by flying debris and many were not serious.  Fortunately there were no fatalities.  Heavy damage was reported by MidAmerica Energy.  On a state wide report, they indicated 200,000 homes  were without electricity, effecting over 500,000 people, at one time during the storm.  In the metropolitan Des Moines area, 100,000 homes were without electricity at the height of the storm.  That number was reduced to around 25,000 36 hours later.  The worst damaged areas were without power for 5 to 6 days.  Heavy damage was also reported by local telephone and cable systems.  In Polk County, the worst damage extended from the Camp Dodge area into the northeast parts of Des Moines.  At least 462 homes in the metro Des Moines area sustained significant damage.  Statewide, 80 homes were destroyed, 559 sustained severe damage, with 1416 others receiving moderate damage.  In the Camp Dodge area, 80 to 90 percent of the brick buildings were damaged with the roofs removed from many of them.  Lightning from the storms struck the WSR-88D in the midst of the storm.  The radar was taken out of service for more than 24 hours because of this.  In addition to the severe weather, flooding quickly became a problem.  Iowa soil was nearly saturated as the weather pattern had been very wet for six weeks previous.  Although rainfall was not extreme, one to three inches of rain fell over a several county area.  This caused widespread urban flooding across north central into central Iowa, though damage from the flooding was not serious.  Crop damage was very difficult to determine and will not likely be clear until the fall harvest.  Reports from some of the local extension agents say damage to the corn ranged up to 75% destroyed in areas with the highest wind, such as the swath that went through central Iowa in association with the tornado there.  No doubt losses will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not in the millions.   Accounts of damage were of course too numerous to document here as the areal extent of the storms was very large.  Countless reports of parts of crop fields being flattened were received.  Semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned by the high winds both in the Des Moines metro area as well as in Newton.  Trees were found on houses over a large part of the state.  One news reported wrote ""there is not a power pole standing between Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa"".  Though not figuratively true, this statement does point out the extensive damage that occurred with these storms.l",,PDC

The first round of thunderstorms also spawned two brief tornado touchdowns to the west of Minden.  Both were reported by trained spotters in the area.  Large hail north of Arapahoe severely damaged the wheat crop in the area.The second round of storms rolled through around midnight CDT with torrential rains and wind driven hail.  Damage was generally confined to crops and, in particular, across a part of northern Hamilton county.  As many as fifty sections of beans, corn, and alfalfa were damaged by the wind and hail.

The combustible situation produced a mesoscale low pressure system which focused the most substantial severe weather in north-central Maryland and the eastern West Virginia panhandle.  The episode featured two small tornadoes and one wind damage event.The main event was a short-lived tornado which tracked through the small community of Swan Pond just east of Martinsburg.  In Swan Pond Orchard, the tornado ripped a garage off the back of a home and knocked down eight miniature apple trees.  The twister moved through a heavily wooded area, knocking down numerous trees before tracking across an open field where it tore the roof off a barn.  It also flipped a trailer, moved a hay wagon, blew out doors to a hangar, and damaged a cinder block outbuilding.This was the second tornado associated with the parent thunderstorm.  The first, perhaps a continuation of one that had struck in extreme northern Frederick Co Virginia moments earlier, cut a brief path across extreme southern Berkeley Co near Ridgeway.  Several trees were blown down, including one onto a mobile home and two more onto nearby homes.

These long-lived, cyclic supercells produced a considerable amount of large hail and some damaging winds in the mountains. The first tornado of the day in western North Carolina occurred in Madison county. Numerous reports of hail as large as golf balls were reported from the mountains. In Madison and Yancey counties, hail covered roads. More supercell thunderstorms developed behind the previous ones and followed similar tracks. In northern Buncombe county, the town of Barnardsville had three separate severe storms cross overhead and drop hail on the ground to a depth of 3 inches. Yancey county also had 3 separate storms move across the county that accumulated hail to 6 inches in depth. The hail was still on the ground the next morning. As the supercells moved into the foothills, they began to curve a little to the right, indicative of strong mesocyclonic circulations present. One supercell produced several tornadoes from Alexander county to Davie county. Another storm produced a tornado that tracked from western Caldwell county into south-central Alexander county. A third supercell that emerged out of the mountains in McDowell county produced several tornadoes from the southern part of that county to northern Mecklenburg county. Damage was fairly significant across western North Carolina with numerous homes either damaged or destroyed. Fortunately, no one was killed. However, 2 people were injured as a result of the violent F4 tornado in eastern Caldwell county. One person received minor injuries from a lightning strike in Yancey county later in the evening.The storms continued to reform in eastern Tennessee until very late in the evening and still produced large hail as they crossed the border into the mountain counties of North Carolina, before weakening shortly after midnight..","A violent, F4 tornado touched down near Dudley Shoals then moved east-southeast cutting a winding path through valleys, to the Alexander county border.

In Vinton a fallen utility pole and electric transformer smashed a car.  The city of Preston suffered heavy tree damage with many homes sustaining minor to moderate damage.  West of Preston lightning struck a home and caused about $10,000 to $12,000 worth of smoke damage. In the Cedar Rapids area about 9,400 customers were without electrical service after power lines were downed by falling tree limbs.  Near the Kirkwood Community College softball fields high winds picked up aluminum bleachers and pushed them through a backstop.",,PDC

The first severe thunderstorm to affect eastern Oklahoma scraped the northwestern part of Osage County, causing a report of a severe thunderstorm gust.  This storm quickly died as it entered Kansas.A second more serious severe thunderstorm formed west of Oklahoma City and tracked all the way to the Arkansas state line south of Fort Smith, traversing Pittsburg, Haskell, and Le Flore Counties.  This storm travelled east along an instability axis and a warm front.  From a radar perspective, this storm was impressive in that it kept a classic, well-defined hook on its entire journey across southeast Oklahoma.  From a human perspective, this storm was impressive in that it produced ten tornadoes in southeast Oklahoma, hail as large as golfballs, damaging thunderstorm winds, and torrential flooding rains.A third cluster of severe thunderstorms developed over Creek County and moved east across Okmulgee, Muskogee, Cherokee, and Adair Counties before weakening as it entered Arkansas.  These storms slowed their movement across Muskogee County and regeneration along the southwest flank of the storms caused torrential rainfalls that dumped nearly three inches of rain in northern Muskogee, southern Cherokee, southern Adair, and northern Sequoyah Counties.  In addition to flooding rains, these storms produced hail as large as nickels and damaging thunderstorm winds.",,PDC

A weak tornado (F1 on the Fujita Scale) moved through Londonderry and West Marlborough Townships.  A second tornado (F1 on the Fujita Scale also) moved through eastern Pocopson and Birmingham Townships.  Damage estimates were around one million dollars and included road clearance, clearing trees from houses and automobiles as well as damage to homes.  Throughout the county one mobile home was destroyed, five homes had major damage or were destroyed, 19 homes had minor to moderate damage and 24 homes had minor or less damage.  The hardest hit communities included Birmingham Township, Cochranville (part of West Fallowfield Township),  Highland Township, Kenneth (including Kenneth Square) Township,  Londonderry Township and New Garden Township.  Only two persons were injured in Cochranville.  Cochranville,  Highland Township,  Londonderry Township,  Lower Oxford Township,  West Fallowfield Township and West Marlborough Township all were declared either local disaster or county emergency areas.  Governor Tom Ridge also declared Chester County a disaster emergency.  About 115,000 homes and businesses lost power.  About 28,000 customers were still without power during the night of June 1st.  Power was not completely restored until the evening of the 4th.  This was the fourth worst and the greatest non-winter storm to affect the PECO Energy service area in its 50 year history.  About 336,000 customers lost power throughout their service area and PECO Energy distributed about 365,000 pounds of dry ice.  Sections of major roads such as U.S. Route 1, and Pennsylvania State Routes 41, 52, 82 and 926 were closed by downed trees and wires.  Even in open sections, traffic crawled due to non working traffic lights.  Roads were still closed in Birmingham, East Fallowfield, Highland, London Grove, Londonderry and New Garden Townships the night of June 1st.  Five southern Chester County School districts had to cancel classes on Monday, June 1st.  One could not reopen until Wednesday, June 3rd.   The line of severe thunderstorms entered the county in West Fallowfield and Lower Oxford Townships about 1240 a.m. EDT on June 1st and wasted no time causing damage.  In Lower Oxford Township poles along Pennsylvania State Route 10 were snapped and Pennsylvania State Route 896 was partially blocked by downed trees.  In West Fallowfield Township, the thunderstorms hit the King Road area of Cochranville the hardest.  About 30 homes were damaged.  A couple of mobile homes were either crushed or severely damaged by fallen trees.  One woman was temporarily trapped.  Several barns or silos were also destroyed.  On one plot over 100 trees were uprooted.  The Red Cross worked with thirteen displaced families in the area.   The first tornado of the night touched down in Londonderry Township at about 12:43 a.m. EDT on June 1st.  The touchdown occurred just north of the intersection of Fernwood and Jackson Roads.  The tornado moved west to east into West Marlborough Township.  It was there it reached its maximum intensity.  The tornado continued to travel almost due east and lifted in the extreme eastern part of the township near Pennsylvania State Route 842.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down, but structural damage since this tornado passed through relatively rural areas was minimal.  The tornado stayed on the ground for about 6 miles and its width was about 100 yards. Even though the tornado lifted,  wind damage continued farther east into East Marlborough Township.  Hundreds of trees were uprooted, at least one vehicle was crushed and a flag pole was bent to the ground.  In northern parts of London Grove Township, a couple of mobile homes were overturned and a tree crushed a garage.   At one point during the night, all major roads were closed in New Garden Township due to downed trees and wires.  As the line headed farther east, almost all of Kenneth Square lost power as large trees were uprooted.  Many homes and vehicles were hit by trees.  Included in the tree casualties, was a 140-year-old Kentucky Coffee Tree, which was one of the oldest in the eastern part of Pennsylvania.   As the line went farther east, it dropped the second tornado of the night.  At about 12:52 a.m. EDT a tornado touched down in the far eastern part of Pocopson Township along Pennsylvania State Route 52 just to the west of the Brandywine River and the intersections of Pennsylvania State Routes 52 and 100.  The tornado moved northwest to southeast into Birmingham Township and intensified into a F1 tornado and caused damage.  The tornado lifted just west of the Dilworthtown Inn in Dilworthtown near the Delaware County line.  Hundreds of trees were down with power lines down in over one hundred locations.  At least five homes had roof and window damage.  The Spring Meadows Development had some of the worst damage with a couple of homes and several vehicles struck by fallen trees.  The tornado was on the ground for about 3 miles and its width was about 100 yards.  It appears as though the winds in this tornado reached near the high end of the F1 scale and probably were close to 100 mph at its maximum intensity.The wind damage was not done in Chester County.  The line of severe thunderstorms sheared off part of the side of a house in West Chester.  In Easttown, eight roads were closed because of downed trees.  While most of the wind damage was in the southern half of the county, a thunderstorm in the far northern part of the county also turned severe in East and South Coventry Townships.

The primary focusing mechanisms were a strong mid level shortwave trough and surface cold front that approached from the west late in the day and during the evening.  As these features encountered an unstable and increasingly moist environment, thunderstorms developed and quickly became severe.  Strongly veering winds that increased with height contributed substantially to the development of tornadic supercells.     Two tornadoes touched down in central New York in the early evening on the 2nd.  Both appeared to be associated with the same cell.  The first tornado occurred in extreme eastern Cortland county in the town of Cincinnatus.  After the twister's brief initial touchdown, it lifted back into the cloud base for several minutes before descending once again in western Chenango county in the town of Pitcher.  Both tornadoes were rated as F1 intensity with fairly narrow damage paths of a quarter mile or less in length and 100 yards or less in width.  Very fortunately, structural damage was kept to a minimum as only two houses sustained appreciable damage.  Also, there were no injuries directly tied to the tornadoes as both homes were unoccupied and sparsely populated areas were affected.  However, damage estimates from Foresty Department personnel still approached a half million dollars as hundreds of trees were cut down.     Elsewhere across central New York, damage was fairly widespread from a combination of intense squall line and bow echo complexes as well as isolated supercells.  One such supercell cut a lengthy path of wind damage over the Finger Lakes region early in the evening from western Yates county all the way through southern Cayuga county.  Hail as large as golf balls was also observed with these storms.  The same thunderstorm complex that became tornadic over portions of Cortland and Chenango counties was also responsible for quite a bit of damage from straight line winds.  Swaths of downed trees and power lines from downburst type winds were interspersed with tornadic damage from Homer in western Cortland county to Norwich in northern Chenango county.  Across the southern tier counties including the western Catskills, severe thunderstorms were more widely separated as a general rule.  Yet, there were two areas of concentrated activity.  One was from Steuben county eastward through the Elmira/Corning area into Tioga county.  Golf ball sized hail and wind gusts estimated at near 80 mph accompanied these storms.  A bow echo complex affected an area from Oneonta in southern Otsego county into northern Delaware county with widespread wind damage just after nightfall.     By late in the evening, remaining severe thunderstorms had pushed either into the eastern Catskills or northern Pennsylvania as a cold front swept through much of central New York.",A severe thunderstorm that had produced wind damage and hail just a short time prior in the town of Taylor became tornadic over Cincinnatus.  Post-storm damage surveys indicate that the tornado touchdown was brief with snapped off trees and some house damage incurred.  One home had its roof almost completely torn off with the front porch also heavily damaged from falling trees.       The swath of damage was only just over 100 yards long with evidence of tornadic winds becoming discontinuous downstream.,PDC

A cold front extended south from the low into Kansas.  South of the warm front, dew point temperatures were in the low 70s.  A speed max passed to the northwest of the state, placing Iowa in the right rear entrance region of the speed max.  This set the stage for thunderstorm development.  A strong low level jet was in place with speeds in excess of 50 knots.  Initially, a small like of strong, but not severe, thunderstorms formed from southwest into north central Iowa.  As the morning progressed, the storms initially produced hail of three quarters inch up to golf ball in size.  The hail event quickly turned into a wind event as the storms accelerated along the line.  Wind damage was widespread.  A roof was taken off of a house in Des Moines as one of the cells moved through.  A later storm took a roof off of a building in West Des Moines later in the morning.  Wind damage was also significant in Webster and Hamilton Counties as the storms moved through.  Numerous reports of sheds blown over were received.  Some of the pieces from the sheds were found over a mile downwind.  A school roof was 40 percent removed in Blairsburg by high winds.  Damage to the building was placed at $150,000.  The next problem was with the storms training over the same areas.  The cells moved northeast along the line with little eastward progress of the line itself.  This caused urban and small stream flooding over a several county area as widespread rainfall of one to two inches occurred in several central Iowa counties.  The situation became more serious in a several county area.  Rainfall of three to five inches was recorded in parts of Dallas, Madison, Polk, Story, and Warren Counties.  This resulted in flash flooding as all creeks and streams swelled over their banks.  The situation became very serious in the larger cities.  In Des Moines, a state of emergency was declared as water of 6 feet or greater in depth choked many of the city intersections.  Hundreds of cars were stalled in the streets and many basements were flooded.  Between the high winds and water, electricity was knocked out to 15000 homes in Des Moines during the height of the storm.  Damage estimates were in the hundreds of thousands of dollars in all of the flash flood counties, and over one million dollars in Polk County, where the Governor declared a state disaster.  A disaster declaration was also made for Dallas County.  Reports indicated that in the Des Moines metropolitan area, up to 10,000 homes had water in the basement.  The city of Des Moines reported that infrastructure losses alone around $1 million.  Crop damage estimates from this event, combined with the event of just a few days earlier, totalled around $100 million.  During the early afternoon hours, the cold front over Nebraska began moving east, resulting in a change in the thunderstorm configuration.  Several bow echo elements formed along the line which caused another round of high winds and also began shifting the line east.  From Des Moines east, numerous places reported winds of 60 to 75 MPH, along with considerable damage.  Seventy two MPH winds buffeted Grinnell in Poweshiek County, breaking out windows in homes there.  Winds approached 85 MPH west of Montezuma causing extensive damage on several farms there.  Two semi-tractortrailor trucks were blown off of I-380 southeast of Waterloo in Black Hawk County.  The highest wind reported was in Tama County, at Montour where 90 MPH winds struck the city, resulting in widespread damage.  One tornado touched down south of Des Moines.  The tornado was small and rain wrapped and produced an intermittent track of minor damage from near Martensdale to northeast of Norwalk in Warren County.  Scattered thunderstorms formed ahead of the main area of thunderstorms during the late morning hours.  Initially, they were not severe, but one did produce a lightning stroke in Grinnell that touched off a minor fire in a house there.",Intermittent track,PDC

The tornado was rated as an F1 (A weak tornado on the Fujita Scale) in Montgomery County and intensified into an F2 (or strong tornado on the Fujita Scale) within Philadelphia.   The worst damage occurred within the unoccupied Byberry Industrial Park as the tornado reached its strongest intensity.  Thirty-five commercial buildings were damaged, nine severely. Damage outside of the industrial park was mainly confined to downed trees.  About ten homes were damaged by fallen trees.  The damage within Philadelphia was discontinuous suggesting the tornado was not on the ground for its entire lifetime across the city.   Damage was estimated at $1.8 million dollars.  Because the buildings were unoccupied, no injuries occurred.The tornado moved into the city from Lower Moreland Township in the Bustleton/Lumar Park area around 120 a.m. EDT.  Trees were split and knocked down.  The tornado intensified into a strong one (F2 on the Fujita Scale) as it crossed into the Byberry Industrial Park.  The worst damage was done in the area around Byberry Road, McNulty Road, Roosevelt Boulevard and Southampton Road.  Five ton air conditioning units were tossed.  Of the 35 commercial buildings damaged, nine were severely damaged and declared ""imminently dangerous"".  Slabs of the roof were tossed 200 yards.  Some buildings lost entire sides, had buckled steel beams, shattered windows and crushed equipment.  The tornado plucked utility poles from the ground.  About 20 poles were knocked over.  Five teams of tree service personnel were overwhelmed.   Damage south of the industrial park became sporadic as the tornado turned toward the southeast.  It lifted just before the Bucks County border near Woodhaven Road just to the southeast of the Franklin Mills Mall. Its path length was about 5.6 miles and path width about 200 yards.     PECO Energy reported 34,000 customers in Philadelphia lost power.  Five thousand still did not have power the evening of the 1st.

Many of these thunderstorms developed rotation with some storms ultimately producing tornadoes.  The first thunderstorms of the day developed over central Oklahoma and then moved eastward toward Okfuskee County after 430 PM CDT, traversing the counties along and just north of I-40 through 730 PM CDT before exiting into Arkansas to the east of Stilwell and Sallisaw.  These thunderstorms produced large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, and two brief tornado touchdowns in Muskogee County.  Other severe thunderstorms developed behind the first cluster, producing severe weather primarily in Creek and Okmulgee Counties from 700 PM to 830 PM CDT.Other severe thunderstorms developed rapidly around 600 PM CDT along a weak cold front across the northern border counties of Oklahoma.  These storms primarily produced large hail.  Further south in southeast Oklahoma, a cap of warm air in the mid-levels of the atmosphere prevented thunderstorm development until around 700 PM CDT with the approach of an upper level disturbance.  Once thunderstorms developed in Pittsburg County, they rapidly became severe and began rotating.  These storms moved east across Haskell and northern Le Flore Counties through 900 PM CDT, producing large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, several brief tornado touchdownsand a tornado producing considerable damage in the small town of Calhoun in northwestern Le Flore County.

Widespread wind damage occurred in Chickasha in Grady County as one storm evolved into a bow-echo.  As the line of storms continued to move east, they developed comma-head radar signatures.  One of these storms produced a small tornado (F0) in Lamar in Hughes County. See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further information and additional reports.","A severe thunderstorm produced a brief tornado in Lamar.  Witnesses described a brief funnel that developed as the storm came across Lamar Mountain just southwest of town. This first funnel lifted and then a second funnel formed and touched down.  The tornado moved north along the west edge of town for about .4 miles then veered to the northeast before lifting.   On the southern end of the path, the roof was blown off a cow shed. Just north of there a travel trailer and dog house were blown over, an antenna was blown down, and a tree was uprooted.  Shutters were blown off the next house to the north.

The primary focusing mechanisms were a strong mid level shortwave trough and surface cold front that approached from the west late in the day and during the evening.  As these features encountered an unstable and increasingly moist environment, thunderstorms developed and quickly became severe.  Strongly veering winds that increased with height contributed substantially to the development of tornadic supercells.     Two tornadoes touched down in central New York in the early evening on the 2nd.  Both appeared to be associated with the same cell.  The first tornado occurred in extreme eastern Cortland county in the town of Cincinnatus.  After the twister's brief initial touchdown, it lifted back into the cloud base for several minutes before descending once again in western Chenango county in the town of Pitcher.  Both tornadoes were rated as F1 intensity with fairly narrow damage paths of a quarter mile or less in length and 100 yards or less in width.  Very fortunately, structural damage was kept to a minimum as only two houses sustained appreciable damage.  Also, there were no injuries directly tied to the tornadoes as both homes were unoccupied and sparsely populated areas were affected.  However, damage estimates from Foresty Department personnel still approached a half million dollars as hundreds of trees were cut down.     Elsewhere across central New York, damage was fairly widespread from a combination of intense squall line and bow echo complexes as well as isolated supercells.  One such supercell cut a lengthy path of wind damage over the Finger Lakes region early in the evening from western Yates county all the way through southern Cayuga county.  Hail as large as golf balls was also observed with these storms.  The same thunderstorm complex that became tornadic over portions of Cortland and Chenango counties was also responsible for quite a bit of damage from straight line winds.  Swaths of downed trees and power lines from downburst type winds were interspersed with tornadic damage from Homer in western Cortland county to Norwich in northern Chenango county.  Across the southern tier counties including the western Catskills, severe thunderstorms were more widely separated as a general rule.  Yet, there were two areas of concentrated activity.  One was from Steuben county eastward through the Elmira/Corning area into Tioga county.  Golf ball sized hail and wind gusts estimated at near 80 mph accompanied these storms.  A bow echo complex affected an area from Oneonta in southern Otsego county into northern Delaware county with widespread wind damage just after nightfall.     By late in the evening, remaining severe thunderstorms had pushed either into the eastern Catskills or northern Pennsylvania as a cold front swept through much of central New York.","The severe cell that had become tornadic just across the county line in eastern Cortland county earlier in the evening remained a tornadic supercell after entering Chenango county.  Aerial damage surveys indicate that the tornado was near ground level for a few minutes in the town of Pitcher.     A swath of forest was heavily damaged for about a quarter of a mile.  Most trees were snapped or sheared off near canopy level.  A few trees were completely uprooted or twisted off the ground.  Fortunately, no homes were in this vicinity.  Foresty Department personnel estimate that hundreds of trees were damaged with fiscal estimates near a quarter of a million dollars.",PDC

The primary focusing mechanisms were a strong mid level shortwave and surface cold front that approached the region during the evening of the 2nd.  Strongly veering wind profiles that increased with height contributed significantly to the development of tornadic supercells.     Two long tracked supercells produced tornadic damage across northeastern Pennsylvania during this event.  The first tornado touched down in southwestern Susquehanna county in Auburn towship just after 9 pm EDT.  This tornado tracked along a 12 mile path through Springville and Lathrop townships.  Several mobile homes were damaged or destroyed and the roof of a small storage building was torn away.  The twister also cut down scores of trees along the way.  Its intensity was rated as F1.  Fortunately, no injuries resulted.     The other twister tracked along approximately a 35 mile path from extreme southeastern Bradford county across the length of northern Wyoming county and into northwestern Lackawanna county before weakening.  The most devastation occurred in the small vacation community of Lake Carey in Wyoming county.  The tornado strengthened to F3 intensity at Lake Carey and killed two people and injured a total of fifteen.  More than 40 homes immediately surrounding the lake were either heavily damaged or destroyed.  Additional residences were damaged or leveled further to the east through East Lemon township in northern Wyoming county.  Isolated structural damage and considerable tree damage was the rule from Terry township in Bradford county eastward to just west of Lake Carey and also from East Lemon township eastward to near Lackawanna State Park where the tornado finally dissipated.  In all, over 50 homes were damaged or destroyed and total damage estimates in the three county area exceeded three million dollars.     Other smaller scale bow echo complexes produced widespread wind damage in the form of downed trees and power lines primarily across the northern tier counties and sections of the Poconos.  Portions of Bradford, Susquehanna, and Wayne counties were without power for most of the night as electrical crews could not keep up with reports of downed wires.       The most severely damaged areas including the Lake Carey vicinity needed assistance from the National Gaurd to clean up excess debris and help with repairs.  Much of northeastern Pennsylvania qualified for federal disaster assistance.","The same line of severe thunderstorms that produced sporadic damage in eastern Bradford county exhibited one intensifying supercell as it edged eastward into Susquehanna county.  This storm ultimately became tornadic.     Ground and aerial damage surveys indicate the tornado first touched down in Auburn township in the southwestern corner of the county.  A discontinuous damage path was evident in Auburn township, mainly along ridge top sections and east of route 267.  Trees were cut down and twisted in a convergently rotating pattern.  One mobile home was destroyed when several large trees fell upon it.  Amazingly, the occupant inside the structure was unharmed.  The twister then continued eastward into Springville township; skipping primarily along the higher elevations and shearing off tree tops.  However, once the tornado crossed to the east of route 29, it appeared to briefly intensify as it ripped the roof off of a small brick storage building and completely leveled another mobile home along state route 3017 just east of Taylor Hill.  Fortunately, the home was vacant at the time.  Once the tornado began climbing the next set of ridges to the east, it lifted back into the cloud base as the pattern of damage was not seen further downstream.     In all, damage estimates were close to $300,000, mainly from structural damage to the aforementioned structures and deforestation.  The intensity was rated as F1 with a damage path of about 12 miles from Auburn township into Lathrop township.  The width of damage was no greater than about 100 yards at any given time.",PDC

Other tornadoes damaged the Oklahoma City Boat Club, portions of The Village and Nichols Hills, the Highland Park neighborhood west of Broadway Extension, and the area near May and Grand Avenues in Oklahoma City. Three weak tornadoes also touched down in open country northwest of El Reno and near Yukon. In addition to damaging tornadoes, the storm produced extensive straight-line wind damage from Lake Hefner, across Nichols Hills and The Village, into northeast Oklahoma County. Winds likely exceeded 100 mph in some areas. There were no fatalities and only 21 relatively minor injuries reported in Oklahoma County. The majority of the injuries were sustained at the Frontier City theme park. Earlier, another supercell thunderstorm produced tornadoes near Longdale in Blaine County and 3 miles southwest of Guthrie.  Supercells that tracked across Noble County and northern Cleveland County produced large hail and severe winds, but no tornadoes.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.","This tornado was the most intense of the day. The tornado touched down approximately 1/4 mile southwest of the corner of Bryant Avenue and Hefner Road, and moved northeast crossing Interstate 35 at the Frontier City theme park parking lot. The tornado continued northeast along northeast 122nd Street and eventually dissipated 1/4 mile northeast of Interstate 44 at Douglas Blvd. The total path length was approximately 5 1/2 miles. Maximum width was 200 yards east of Interstate 35 and south of Interstate 44. The tornado was rated F2 (At 122nd Street approximately 1-2 miles east of I-35). Seventeen minor injuries (3 transported to hospital) occurred at Frontier City. Along the track, major structural damage occurred to businesses along Interstate 35 from 122nd Street southward for approximately three-quarters of a mile. The Frontier City theme park was among the hardest hit businesses. The tornado passed through the parking lot damaging numerous vehicles before striking a two-story concrete block building at the northeast corner of the park. This building suffered partial failure of external walls and the entire roof was removed. Damage to adjacent areas of the park was mainly due to strong inflow into the tornado.On the east side of Interstate 35, a Texaco truck stop was severely damaged. Empty semi-tractor trailers located in the east parking lot of the truck stop were over turned and rolled tens of feet. One trailer was briefly airborne and landed on another empty trailer. A small portable building containing a CB radio shop in the parking area was completely swept away into a grove of trees east of the lot. Numerous homes suffered major damage to roofs, windows, and garage doors in the Nottingham and Quail Ridge Run subdivisions located along 122nd Street 1-2 miles east of I35. Several homes suffered major or nearly complete roof failure, though most exterior walls remained intact. These homes were of recent construction and were well built with brick exterior facades (some likely in excess of $200K). No means of anchoring the roofs to the exterior walls was noted. The tornado may have approached F3 at times in these neighborhoods. The most severly damaged home was located atop a small hill with garage doors on the upwind side of the home. Debris patterns suggest the garage doors failed allowing the wind to lift the roof. Without the roof in place, failure of the external garage walls occurred. The most severe damage to trees occurred in these subdivisions and areas immediately adjacent.",PDC

After a period of erratic movement, Frances settled on a northwest track that brought it ashore in the early morning hours of September 11th between Port Aransas and Port Oconner, Texas.  Due to the large pressure difference between Tropical Storm Frances and a high pressure system over the eastern United States, a prolonged period of strong east and southeast winds that occasionally reached tropical storm force affected coastal sections of southeast Louisiana.  Peak wind gusts of 60 mph at 1029 CST on the 10th and 55 mph at 1826 PM on the 10th were recorded at the Burrwood and Grand Isle C-MAN stations, respectively.  A wind gust of 62 mph was observed at a buoy in eastern Lake Pontchartrain near the Rigolets during a squall at 1510 CST on the 11th.  Significant tidal flooding occurred during the event with tides averaging 2 to 4 feet above normal along the southeast Louisiana coastline and in Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas.  The persistent strong winds and resulting high tides pushed a considerable amount of water into the tidal lakes of southeast Louisiana parishes and well inland along marshes, bayous, and other low-lying areas.  This resulted in a number of  homes outside of the levee protection systems being flooded and caused the flooding of many roadways.  The most severe flooding occurred in Terrebonne, Lafourche, and lower Jefferson Parishes.  Many businesses along the Harvey Canal in Jefferson Parish were damaged due to storm surge flooding,  and the levee along the canal was nearly overtopped.  In addition, very heavy rainfall occurred with most locations of southeast Louisiana receiving a minimum of 5 inches during the storm with some areas south of Lake Pontchartrain receiving 15 to 30 inches of rain.  The heavy rainfall resulted in widespread flash flooding south of Lake Pontchartrain.The flash flooding peaked on September 11th when intense rainfall associated with a Tropical Storm Francis rainband resulted in rainfall amounts of 5 to 7 inches within a two to three hours period over portions of the greater New Orleans area.  By late afternoon, rainfall totals had reached from 8 to 12 inches.  Rainfall runoff overwhelmed drainage pumping capacity producing widespread and deep flooding in the streets of the New Orleans metropolitan area.  Ground transportation throughout much of Orleans Parish and portions of adjacent parishes was brought to a near standstill during the afternoon by the flooding, stranding many at work, school, or in autos.  The street flooding subsided during the evening. Around 800 homes and 30 businesses were flooded in Jefferson Parish from either storm surge flooding outside of the hurricane protection levees and flash flooding from heavy rainfall.  In Orleans Parish at least 290 single family homes and 124 apartments and businesses were flooded.  A tornado developed in an outer rainband associated with Tropical Storm Francis on the evening of September 10th and followed a path approximately 4 miles long from near Cut Off to Larose killing a 22 year old male in a mobile home.  The most severe damage occurred in the first one half to three quarters mile of the path.  Several mobile homes were destroyed, 3 conventional houses had roofs taken off, two houses were moved off their piling foundation, and two businesses suffered extensive damage.  The tornado was strongest near the beginning of the track where F2 damage occurred. Over the remainder of the track, F1 damage was reported.",,PDC

This system dragged a warm front across northeastern Pennsylvania.  Behind this front, a southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for the development of severe weather later that afternoon as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From late in the afternoon until late that evening, northeastern Pennsylvania was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, nine separate tornadoes touched down on this day.  Overall damage estimates run into the millions with many homes and structures heavily damaged or destroyed.  The most devastating storms occurred in Pike county.  Within about a 3 hour stretch from 7 to 10 pm EDT, four different twisters affected the county.  One tornadic cell was responsible for knocking down thousands of healthy large trees in and around Promised Land State Park with several vacation homes damaged or leveled.  Fortunately, injuries were kept at a minimum.       Widespread straight line wind damage also occurred with hailstones the size of ping pong balls falling in some places.  The north side of Scranton had extensive wind damage as a storm passed through shortly before 10 pm EDT and sections of Wayne and Luzerne counties had roads closed and/or blocked from falling trees for more than 2 days after the storm.  Pennsylvania Power and Light Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power at the height of the storms on the evening of the 31st.  Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.","A severe thunderstorm became tornadic just south of Interstate 84 and east of Tarey Hill in Blooming Grove township around 8:20 pm EDT.  The tornado cut approximately a 3 mile by 200 yard path paralleling Interstate 84.       The twister moved through heavily forested areas and mowed down hundreds of trees in its path.  Again, many of the trees were quite sizeable and appeared to be toppled easily.  The damage pattern was circular in spots as viewed by aerial surveys.  Fortunately, little in the way of houses or populated regions were in the path of this particular tornado.  The tornado's intensity seemed to fluctuate between F1 and F2.  The tornado lifted back up just east of route 739 near Cranberry Ridge as little in the way of damage was seen downstream of this point.

This flow brought moisture north with surface dew point temperatures rising into the low to mid 50s.  Lapse rates were steep with the freezing level only around 9000 feet.  The low freezing level contributed to widespread hail as thunderstorms formed during the mid afternoon hours.  Synoptically, an upper level low pressure system was advancing northeast from the southwest U.S.  A surface low formed over Oklahoma with a trough extending northeast into eastern Nebraska.  This trough served as the focusing boundary for the thunderstorms to form on.  Initially , a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over southeast Nebraska and moved into southwest and west central Iowa.  Most of the storms produced at least pea to marble size hail.  There were several reports of hail covering the ground.   In Carroll County, pea to slightly larger size hail accumulated to a depth of an inch in the town of Arcadia.  Significant hail fell in Boone and Webster Counties where golf ball size hail was reported.  The area around Dayton was particularly hard hit with the golf ball size hail covering the ground.  During the storms strongest period, several small tornadoes were spawned.  One touched down briefly in Greene County north of Churdan.  A short time later, two other brief touchdowns were reported.  A Ham radio spotter reported a brief touch down near Highway 169 in Webster County south of Dayton.  Another brief touchdown occurred in Green County north of Scranton near the same time.  All of these tornadoes touched down in open fields and caused little to no damage.  They were also quite small and weak.  The other problem during this event was with the rainfall.  The soil in Iowa was already close to saturation.  As a result, much of the rain that fell ran off, causing local and urban flooding.  Rainfall of one to three inches was common from west central Iowa into parts of the north central counties.  The heaviest rainfall report was received from Denison with 3.40 inches.  There were several reports of one to two inches falling in one half hours time.  In spite of the wet soil conditions and heavy rainfall, flooding was relatively minor, though considerable ponding did occur.",,PDC

Damage included a completely destroyed dairy barn, two completely destroyed house trailers, and at least 21 other structures heavily damaged, many with roofs partially or completely peeled off.  Several cows were killed, with one cow thrown through the air over 100 yards.  A clearly visible 300-yard wide, 1-mile long swath of trees which were completely sheared/uprooted was present near the Pennsylvania/West Virginia state border.  One Fayette County official estimated at least two million dollars damage in lost timber alone in that county.

Strong upper level dynamics moved over the state over the top of an unstable air mass.  Surface dew point temperatures were in the low 70s with actual temperatures in the upper 70s to low 80s.  CAPE values rose to between 2500 and 3500 J/kg.  The situation became complex during the afternoon as several bands of severe thunderstorms developed.  Some areas of the state were affected three times during the day as the storms raced northeast around 60 MPH.  The main severe feature with the storms was high wind.  There were numerous reports of wind gusts of 60 to 75 MPH.  Some were even higher.  One of the highest reports came from Atlantic in Cass County.  Ninety one MPH winds there threw several cars and a few semi-tractortrailer trucks off of Interstate 80.  High winds in Kossuth County at Algona resulted in roof damage at a nursing home there.  Part of the roof was removed by the winds with the damage estimates to the building places at around $200,000.  Another cluster of storms moved into north central Iowa and caused widespread damage in Cerro Gordo and Worth Counties.  Both were hit with winds around 70 MPH.  There were numerous other reports of damage to farm buildings around the state ranging from corn cribs damaged to barns being destroyed.  Damage to trees and power lines was extensive.  North of Algona, along U.S. Highway 169, seventy eight power poles were downed by the high winds resulting in a four day closure of the highway.  Utility damage around the county was estimated at between $600,000 and $800,000, while insurance adjusters estimated damage around the county at $1.2 million.  There were some reports of hail, especially during the first few hours of the event.  The largest hail was around golf ball in size.  In addition to the wind and hail, there were several tornado touch downs in the state.  A tornado touched down in Kossuth County and did over $1 million in damage.  The tornado destroyed 2 houses with another 10 sustaining major damage.  Fifteen farmsteads were destroyed as well.  Kossuth County was later declared a disaster area.  There was also considerable damage to barns and other farm buildings across the county.  The outflow from the tornadic storm in Kossuth County pushed an 85 MPH wind gust south into Humboldt County.  The high winds blew over 41 railroad cars of the Union Pacific Railroad south of Ottosen.  A band of 80 to 90 MPH winds swept across Franklin and Butler Counties.  Damage was widespread.  There was one report of the wind carrying the family dog over one half mile from home.  The dog was later found safe and healthy.  Another of the stronger tornadoes included one in Wright County that was on the ground for over 10 miles.  It damaged several farm buildings along its path.  Several 2 x 4's were driven into the ground north of Clarion by the tornado.  Another fairly strong tornado touched down in Crawford County.  The rope tornado touched down southeast of Denison.  It hit a train about 3 miles east of Denison and derailed nine cars of the Union Pacific freight train.  The engineer saw it coming and thought it was so small that nothing would happen.  There was also minor damage to 1 house and several out buildings.  There were a few other brief touch downs around the state, however no damage was reported with them.   The rapid movement of the storms prevented a lot of the flooding that would have otherwise occurred.  Repeat thunderstorms passing over Kossuth County did cause some urban flooding.  Damage was relatively minor, however several homes reported minor flooding.  As the storms moved across Hancock County, lightning struck a house in the town of Britt.  The kitchen sink was blown away from the wall and all of the appliances and the electrical equipment in the house was damaged.

Shortly after the storm exhibited strong low- and mid-level rotation, a combination of large hail, damaging straight-line winds, and a tornado occurred in the Bunker Hill area.The most impressive event was a brief tornado, witnessed for much of its path by a local resident.  The twister touched down along Tory Town Road and continued east-southeast along Sam Mason Road, crossing Interstate 81 before dissipating shortly after crossing federal highway 11.  The tornado had multiple vortices - the eyewitness noted at least 5 spinning finger-shaped tendrils as the twister passed.Damage on Tory Town Road included a pushed in a wall of a home, one uprooted tree which totalled a parked sport-utility vehicle, and a destroyed barn.  Along and just north of Sam Mason Road, damage included numerous snapped and twisted tree tops.  One uprooted tree smashed into a home causing substantial damage to an adjacent shop.  Five windows were blown out.  Along Sam Mason Road east of Interstate 81 , at least a dozen large trees were uprooted, and several sheds were damaged.  One of the sheds was large - 12 by 36 feet.  Two horses inside sustained minor injuries (from cuts).Straight-line wind damage occurred about a mile northeast of the tornado's location - along and near Runnymeade Road.

This severe weather event was characterized by several large hail reports, with golf-ball sized hail reports received from Kent, Barry, Eaton, Ingham, and Jackson Counties and hail of 2 to 3 inches in diameter associated with a supercell thunderstorm as it tracked east-southeast across southern Ingham and northern Jackson County. This supercell thunderstorm developed over eastern Barry County and tracked across Eaton County, southwest Ingham County, and northern Jackson County. This storm resulted in several wind damage and large hail reports, an F0 tornado in southeast Eaton County, and an F1 tornado touched down in north central Jackson County near Layton Corners. No injuries were reported with the tornadoes, but damage was estimated at half a million dollars across Henrietta and Waterloo Townships in northern Jackson County. The supercell thunderstorm resulted in approximately 12,500 power outages across Eaton and Jackson Counties.","The Jackson County Emergency Management Coordinator confirmed a weak tornado touched down just west of Layton Corners, in rural eastern Rives Township, and travelled east-southeast to near Waterloo, along the Washtenaw County line. The tornado was not on the ground for the entire 11.3 mile path, but due to the heavily wooded rural areas it traversed, exact path lengths could not be determined. Path width was narrow, estimated to be 50 yards at maximum width. No injuries or deaths were associated with this F1 tornado. Damage consisted of downed trees and power lines, roof damage to approximately 12 homes, minor structural damage mainly caused by large hail (broken windows, damaged siding, damaged vehicles and aluminum campers) and fallen trees, and overturned boats on Pleasant Lake in Henrietta Township. Hail was estimated to have reached 2 to 3 inches in diameter in association with this tornadic storm. The most significant damage was reported around the Pleasant Lake area, where several boats were overturned and several homes reported minor to moderate structural damage. Along North Meridian Road from near Layton Corners along the west end of Pleasant Lake, 2 homes reported destroyed garages. Pleasant Lake County Park was closed due to downed trees. Waterloo State Recreation Area reported hundreds of trees uprooted, which resulted in the closing of some roads and horse trails.

Many of these thunderstorms developed rotation with some storms ultimately producing tornadoes.  The first thunderstorms of the day developed over central Oklahoma and then moved eastward toward Okfuskee County after 430 PM CDT, traversing the counties along and just north of I-40 through 730 PM CDT before exiting into Arkansas to the east of Stilwell and Sallisaw.  These thunderstorms produced large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, and two brief tornado touchdowns in Muskogee County.  Other severe thunderstorms developed behind the first cluster, producing severe weather primarily in Creek and Okmulgee Counties from 700 PM to 830 PM CDT.Other severe thunderstorms developed rapidly around 600 PM CDT along a weak cold front across the northern border counties of Oklahoma.  These storms primarily produced large hail.  Further south in southeast Oklahoma, a cap of warm air in the mid-levels of the atmosphere prevented thunderstorm development until around 700 PM CDT with the approach of an upper level disturbance.  Once thunderstorms developed in Pittsburg County, they rapidly became severe and began rotating.  These storms moved east across Haskell and northern Le Flore Counties through 900 PM CDT, producing large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, several brief tornado touchdownsand a tornado producing considerable damage in the small town of Calhoun in northwestern Le Flore County.  At the time of the Calhoun tornado, the WSR-88D near Fort Smith had its first algorithm-induced tornado vortex signature (TVS).",Brief tornado touchdown in open country,PDC

The first two storms developed quickly over central Wisconsin and then tracked east-southeast through the Fox Cities. These two storms primarily produced large hail (1 to 2 inches in diameter) and some wind damage. A brief tornado touched down with the first storm near Menasha (Winnebago co.).  The third storm developed farther north in the northeast part of the state. This storm evolved more slowly, but went through the classic life-cycle of a tornadic supercell and spawned an F3 tornado in Door county.Large hail struck the Fox Cities, especially Appleton, producing over $5 million in damage to vehicles and roofs of buildings.  This was the second multi-million dollar hailstorm this year in Appleton.  In Sherwood (Calumet co.), hail damage to a golf course was so severe that it did not open until two days later.  In Brillion (Calumet co.), hail shattered large glass panels of a church.The most severe damage occurred when a tornado tore a path 5.1 miles long and over a half-mile wide across Door county.  The tornado came onshore from Green Bay at Murphy Park, on the Door county west coast at 630 pm.  Thousands of trees were flattened in the heavily wooded area.  About 30 homes, businesses and barns were destroyed or heavily damaged by the storm, but only two minor injuries were reported.  Some livestock, however, including five horses, were lost.  The tornado knocked down seven power poles holding electrical transmission lines, bringing blackouts to most of the north half of Door county.  Thirty adults and 17 children at a campground found refuge in a concrete building as the tornado approached the grounds.  Two minor injuries occurred at the camping resort as it took a direct hit.

Many of these thunderstorms developed rotation with one storm ultimately producing a tornado.The storm that produced a tornado was the first to move into Arkansas.  It first developed over Sequoyah County in Oklahoma and then moved into northern Crawford County around 715 PM CDT.  From there, it developed very rapidly and began rotating, finally producing a tornado touchdown near Lake Fort Smith.  Besides a tornado, this storm also produced hail to the size of golfballs.  Another cluster of severe thunderstorms, with a history of brief tornado touchdowns and funnel clouds in Oklahoma, moved across northern Crawford County between 830 and 900 PM CDT.  Finally, a severe thunderstorm with a long history of rotation and tornadoes moved across southern Sebastian County between 900 and 930 PM CDT.  Thankfully, there were no known tornadoes in Sebastian County, but the storm produced hail as large as golfballs.  The severe thunderstorms formed as a weak cold front shifted south over the area and a wave of low pressure approached from the west and southwest.  An upper level disturbance helped to break a cap of warm air in the mid-levels which had held firm for most of the day.",A tornado was reported over Lake Fort Smith.  Amateur video captured this wide-funnelled storm as it moved across the hilly terrain of northern Crawford County.  Path length and width are estimated.,PDC

Many of these thunderstorms developed rotation with some storms ultimately producing tornadoes.  The first thunderstorms of the day developed over central Oklahoma and then moved eastward toward Okfuskee County after 430 PM CDT, traversing the counties along and just north of I-40 through 730 PM CDT before exiting into Arkansas to the east of Stilwell and Sallisaw.  These thunderstorms produced large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, and two brief tornado touchdowns in Muskogee County.  Other severe thunderstorms developed behind the first cluster, producing severe weather primarily in Creek and Okmulgee Counties from 700 PM to 830 PM CDT.Other severe thunderstorms developed rapidly around 600 PM CDT along a weak cold front across the northern border counties of Oklahoma.  These storms primarily produced large hail.  Further south in southeast Oklahoma, a cap of warm air in the mid-levels of the atmosphere prevented thunderstorm development until around 700 PM CDT with the approach of an upper level disturbance.  Once thunderstorms developed in Pittsburg County, they rapidly became severe and began rotating.  These storms moved east across Haskell and northern Le Flore Counties through 900 PM CDT, producing large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, several brief tornado touchdownsand a tornado producing considerable damage in the small town of Calhoun in northwestern Le Flore County.  At the time of the Calhoun tornado, the WSR-88D near Fort Smith had its first algorithm-induced tornado vortex signature (TVS).","At 838 PM CDT, a tornado touched down in the small community of Calhoun.  Six homes in Calhoun were damaged, four of which were considered destroyed.  One of the six was a mobile home.  Two minor injuries occurred when a home was lifted off of its concrete block foundation and destroyed.  Wind speed estimates based on the damage suggests velocities were in the upper end of the F1 category, meaning wind in Calhoun were near 110 mph.",PDC

The primary focusing mechanisms were a strong mid level shortwave and surface cold front that approached the region during the evening of the 2nd.  Strongly veering wind profiles that increased with height contributed significantly to the development of tornadic supercells.     Two long tracked supercells produced tornadic damage across northeastern Pennsylvania during this event.  The first tornado touched down in southwestern Susquehanna county in Auburn towship just after 9 pm EDT.  This tornado tracked along a 12 mile path through Springville and Lathrop townships.  Several mobile homes were damaged or destroyed and the roof of a small storage building was torn away.  The twister also cut down scores of trees along the way.  Its intensity was rated as F1.  Fortunately, no injuries resulted.     The other twister tracked along approximately a 35 mile path from extreme southeastern Bradford county across the length of northern Wyoming county and into northwestern Lackawanna county before weakening.  The most devastation occurred in the small vacation community of Lake Carey in Wyoming county.  The tornado strengthened to F3 intensity at Lake Carey and killed two people and injured a total of fifteen.  More than 40 homes immediately surrounding the lake were either heavily damaged or destroyed.  Additional residences were damaged or leveled further to the east through East Lemon township in northern Wyoming county.  Isolated structural damage and considerable tree damage was the rule from Terry township in Bradford county eastward to just west of Lake Carey and also from East Lemon township eastward to near Lackawanna State Park where the tornado finally dissipated.  In all, over 50 homes were damaged or destroyed and total damage estimates in the three county area exceeded three million dollars.     Other smaller scale bow echo complexes produced widespread wind damage in the form of downed trees and power lines primarily across the northern tier counties and sections of the Poconos.  Portions of Bradford, Susquehanna, and Wayne counties were without power for most of the night as electrical crews could not keep up with reports of downed wires.       The most severely damaged areas including the Lake Carey vicinity needed assistance from the National Gaurd to clean up excess debris and help with repairs.  Much of northeastern Pennsylvania qualified for federal disaster assistance.","A supercell thunderstorm became tornadic over southeastern portions of the county in Terry township.  Eyewitness reports and damage surveys indicate that the twister first touched down just east of Robwood mountain and just west of State Route 2015 around 945 pm EDT.  At this location, a mobile home was knocked off its foundation about 8 feet and sustained heavy damage on its front side.  Fortunately for the two occupants who were inside the structure when the tornado struck, a farm vehicle, pickup truck, and storage shed all acted to stop the forward momentum of the trailer and prevent it from rolling down a fairly steep hill just ahead.  Another storage building just north of the mobile home was severely damaged with its roof completely torn off and some metal beams removed from the siding.  As the tornadic cell continued eastward, the funnel appeared to elevate for a time with sporadic damage at tree top level for about a mile downstream.  Once the storm crossed just east of Billetts Pond, it descended to flatten a large barn.  Debris was scattered in all directions from where the barn once stood with a large section of the roof thrown 200-300 yards downwind.  Meanwhile, a newly built home with a large rear deck only 150 yards or so from the barn sustained relatively minor damage.       Further to the east through Wyalusing and Tuscarora townships, the damage path became somewhat discontinuous once again and was confined mainly to hilltop sections with trees sheared off.  Structural damage was not seen in these areas as they were sparsely populated.       From the spot where the twister first touched down in Terry township eastward to the Wyoming county line, the length of the damage path was about 6 miles.  The widths varied from 200 to 400 yards.  Emergency management officials tallied total damages at just under a half million dollars.",PDC

NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts from the Tennessee Towers and was off the air for about 24 hours. 30 private airplanes were damaged at Cornelia Fort Airport. Estimated damage to the airplanes was 3 million dollars.  35 buildings in downtown Nashville were ""red tagged"", meaning these buildings were structurally unsound.  Many signs in Davidson county were blown down or severely damaged. The tornado blew down 3 out of 10 construction cranes on the construction site of the Tennessee Oiler's Football Stadium near the Cumberland River. The tornado continued east and hit the residential section of East Nashville. At least 300 homes were damaged in East Nashville. Many homes lost a good part of their roofs, trees were uprooted, telephone poles were knocked down. St. Ann's  Episcopal Church, which is well over 100 years old, received major damage. Uprooted trees, damaged roofs to many homes was the story across Donelson and Hermitage. Numerous windows were blown out from the Gaylord Building in Donelson. About half the trees, that is over a thousand trees, were blown down at Andrew Jackson's home, The Hermitage. The Hermitage is a 600 acre estate of the former President. Some of those trees were well over 200 years old, and a few of those trees that were destroyed were planted by Andrew Jackson himself. Mayor Phil Bredesen closed downtown Nashville of Friday, April 17. Many workers had an unscheduled holiday. The downtown area was reopened Monday, April 20. This gave time for cleanup crews to remove broken glass and repair downed power lines.  Nashville Electric Service said 75,000 customers were without power.",PDC

This storm travelled east along an instability axis and a warm front.  From a radar perspective, this storm was impressive in that it kept a classic, well-defined hook on its entire journey across southeast Oklahoma.  From a human perspective, this storm was impressive in that it produced ten tornadoes in southeast Oklahoma, hail as large as golfballs, damaging thunderstorm winds, and torrential flooding rains.A third cluster of severe thunderstorms developed over Creek County and moved east across Okmulgee, Muskogee, Cherokee, and Adair Counties before weakening as it entered Arkansas.  These storms slowed their movement across Muskogee County and regeneration along the southwest flank of the storms caused torrential rainfalls that dumped nearly three inches of rain in northern Muskogee, southern Cherokee, southern Adair, and northern Sequoyah Counties.

This storm produced at least six tornadoes as it tracked from Canadian County across Oklahoma County during the early evening. The most damaging tornado (an F2)  touched down in northeast Oklahoma City and crossed Interstate 35 near the Frontier City theme park. Other tornadoes damaged the Oklahoma City Boat Club, portions of The Village and Nichols Hills, the Highland Park neighborhood west of Broadway Extension, and the area near May and Grand Avenues in Oklahoma City. Three weak tornadoes also touched down in open country northwest of El Reno and near Yukon. In addition to damaging tornadoes, the storm produced extensive straight-line wind damage from Lake Hefner, across Nichols Hills and The Village, into northeast Oklahoma County. Winds likely exceeded 100 mph in some areas. There were no fatalities and only 21 relatively minor injuries reported in Oklahoma County. The majority of the injuries were sustained at the Frontier City theme park. Earlier, another supercell thunderstorm produced tornadoes near Longdale in Blaine County and 3 miles southwest of Guthrie.  Supercells that tracked across Noble County and northern Cleveland County produced large hail and severe winds, but no tornadoes.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.","This tornado touched down 1 block west of north May Avenue and Pembroke Terrace and moved east to Woods Park in Nichols Hills. Total path length was 1.5 miles and maximum width was 75 yards. This tornado was rated F2(113-157 mph). Four persons were injured and transported to local hospitals. Considerable damage was done to the strip mall in the 7400 block of north May Avenue. Windows were blown out of several businesses, several lost roofs, power lines were downed and large signs were bent.  One business on the east side of May Ave. suffered collapse of an exterior south facing wall. On Pembroke Terrace, an RV was thrown into a house, a car was over-turned, trees were toppled, and shingles and roof decking were partially blown away. Lesser damage occurred eastward into Nichols Hills. Interestingly, this tornado rotated anticyclonically. Although the over-turned car and major damage to one wood frame house roof suggested the tornado may have reached F2 intensity in a very small area, the majority of the damage was consistent with an F1 rating.",PDC

A large mesoscale convective system developed over northwest Iowa and moved east during the evening hours. Initially, the system produced hail over an inch in diameter, but the main severe weather associated with the storms was high winds.

Windows were blown out at a mall department store in Webster County at Fort Dodge.  Winds of 65  to 80 MPH were common in many areas.

This system dragged a warm front northeastward across central New York.  A southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for severe weather that afternoon and evening as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From early in the afternoon until the evening hours, central New York was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, six separate tornadoes touched down on this day in central New York.  The most devastating twister cut a discontinuous sixty plus mile track from southeastern Tioga county across southern Broome county and into Delaware county where it finally lifted back into the cloud base.  This tornado alone damaged or destroyed more than 30 homes and injured nearly 20 people.  Very fortunately, no fatalities occurred.  Another violent tornado ripped through southern sections of Otsego county between Laurens and Milford.  Thousands of trees were snapped off or uprooted with large sections of forest completely taken out.  Several residences were leveled and many roads were impassable for days due to the fallen debris.  The damage toll from this day's tornadoes ran into the millions.     Several strong bow echo complexes also affected central New York.  From southern Chenango county through the lower half of Otsego county, one such storm took out hundreds of trees and inflicted considerable structural damage in and around Oneonta.  One man was killed in Oneonta when hit by a falling tree limb.  Throughout Onondaga county, wind gusts estimated at 90 to 100 mph caused widespread damage early in the evening between 6:00 and 6:30 pm EDT.  Two large transmission towers near Nedrow were toppled from the winds and many buildings had blown out windows and/or roof damage.     Hail as large as 3 to 4 inches in diameter accompanied some of the tornadic supercells across New York's southern tier; smashing windows, severely denting cars, and causing crop losses.  New York State Electric and Gas Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power during the height of the storms late that afternoon and evening.  Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.","The same tornadic supercell that moved through southern portions of Broome county crossed into Delaware county in Deposit around 6:45 pm EDT.  At that point, the tornado was still quite strong and maintained an intensity of category F3.  Several more homes were severely damaged as the twister moved over route 8 and areas just west of Cannonsville Reservoir.  Again, large swaths of trees were cut down and hail larger than baseballs was observed.       Once the cell passed on to the east across Tompkins and Colchester townships, it weakened as tornado intensity decreased to F1.  Significant tree damage was seen in both ground and aerial damage surveys along hilltop areas just north and east of Cannonsville Reservoir.  Hundreds of tree tops were estimated to be twisted off with several utility poles also taken out in these areas.       Further east towards Downsville, tornado intensity fluctuated between F0 and F1 with most of the damage to trees along ridge tops.  Fortunately, the twister skipped along sparsely populated areas for the most part.  As a result, structural damage and injuries were kept to a minimum.  Once the cell reached the eastern end of Pepacton Reservoir, it weakened further with the tornado apparently lifting back into the cloud base.      Emergency management officials estimated damage totals approaching a million dollars.  The majority of the damage occurred in Deposit.  The town of Deposit was placed under a local state of emergency for several days with this area also eventually receiving federal aid.",PDC

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.",,PDC

Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.","A supercell thunderstorm became tornadic as it crossed southern portions of the county around 6:30 pm EDT.  The storm cut nearly a 5 mile path from Laurens eastward into Milford township.       This twister incurred major damage to heavily forested areas.  Thousands of trees were laid out with the width of damage varying up to nearly a half mile in spots.  Trees were blown over in a chaotic and almost circular pattern as viewed from aerial damage surveys.  Several homes within the path of the twister also sustained heavy damage.  In the town of Laurens, a well built home was nearly destroyed with only the back and a portion of the side wall left in tact.  Many local roads were closed for up to 3 days as fallen trees made them completely impassable.  This included portions of routes 12 and 44.     The cell appeared to weaken as it approached Interstate 88 just east of Milford.       County emergency officials estimated damage totals in excess of three quarters of a million dollars from this twister.  Most of it stemmed from deforestation, repair of utility poles, and other repairs to homes and public structures.  Three minor injuries were sustained from falling tree limbs and flying debris.",PDC

At least 22 tornadoes occurred throughout Oklahoma, of which seven were in northeast Oklahoma.  This outbreak of severe weather resulted as a powerful upper level storm system moved across the central plains and surface low pressure developed over southwest Oklahoma.  Warm humid air quickly invaded the area on the morning of October 4 and then collided with a cold front moving southward by evening.  The threat from these storms ran the full range of possibilities from destructive tornadoes to damaging winds to very large hail up to the size of baseballs.Numerous storms occurred on the evening of October 4, mainly north of Interstate 40.  The two most significant storms both moved eastward out of central Oklahoma.  One produced an F1 tornado that passed through Pawnee.  The other produced a 27-mile track F2 tornado that started in Okfuskee County and ended in Okmulgee County.  This second storm later went on to produce considerable hail and wind damage in the city of Okmulgee.  Many other thunderstorms developed during the evening in central Oklahoma, fanned by upper level winds in excess of 100 knots.  These storms moved into northeast Oklahoma, causing additional severe weather late in the evening that gradually spread eastward to the Arkansas state line.  After midnight, the storms congealed and became a slow-moving line of thunderstorms that sat over nearly the same area of northeast Oklahoma through the overnight hours.  The severe threat gradually diminished through the night, and flooding became the main problem.  For more information on the flooding, see the separate event entry for the flooding.  By late on the afternoon of October 5, the slow-moving line had moved into southeast Oklahoma and flared up during the heat of the afternoon, causing a few additional severe weather reports in the form of strong winds.","An F0 tornado touched down just northeast of Watova around 1005 PM CDT, destroying a barn on Section Road 27.  The tornado continued east, destroying the old one-room Terrell School Building near Section Roads 27 and 415.  A mobile home at Section Roads 26 and 416 lost most of its roof.  Portions of the roof were wrapped around trees over one hundred yards southeast of the home.  From there, the tornado most likely crossed Lake Oologah and continued to an area 3 miles north of New Alluwe by 1015 PM CDT, where the tornado destroyed a shed, damaged a house, damaged a barn, and knocked down several trees.

In Madison and Yancey counties, hail covered roads. More supercell thunderstorms developed behind the previous ones and followed similar tracks. In northern Buncombe county, the town of Barnardsville had three separate severe storms cross overhead and drop hail on the ground to a depth of 3 inches. Yancey county also had 3 separate storms move across the county that accumulated hail to 6 inches in depth. The hail was still on the ground the next morning. As the supercells moved into the foothills, they began to curve a little to the right, indicative of strong mesocyclonic circulations present. One supercell produced several tornadoes from Alexander county to Davie county. Another storm produced a tornado that tracked from western Caldwell county into south-central Alexander county. A third supercell that emerged out of the mountains in McDowell county produced several tornadoes from the southern part of that county to northern Mecklenburg county.

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's ""gust front"" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently ""microbursts"" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.  Overall, approximately twelve people sustained injuries and damage was estimated around $16 million.","A tornado touched down initially 4 miles east northeast of Avon, travelling to the east southeast.

This system dragged a warm front across northeastern Pennsylvania.  Behind this front, a southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for the development of severe weather later that afternoon as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From late in the afternoon until late that evening, northeastern Pennsylvania was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, nine separate tornadoes touched down on this day.  Overall damage estimates run into the millions with many homes and structures heavily damaged or destroyed.  The most devastating storms occurred in Pike county.  Within about a 3 hour stretch from 7 to 10 pm EDT, four different twisters affected the county.  One tornadic cell was responsible for knocking down thousands of healthy large trees in and around Promised Land State Park with several vacation homes damaged or leveled.  Fortunately, injuries were kept at a minimum.       Widespread straight line wind damage also occurred with hailstones the size of ping pong balls falling in some places.  The north side of Scranton had extensive wind damage as a storm passed through shortly before 10 pm EDT and sections of Wayne and Luzerne counties had roads closed and/or blocked from falling trees for more than 2 days after the storm.  Pennsylvania Power and Light Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power at the height of the storms on the evening of the 31st.  Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.","The cell that produced tornadic damage earlier both in southern Wayne county and just upstream in Promised Land State Park dropped a tornado once again across the southern and southeastern portions of Pike county.  A nearly continuous 20 mile path was uncovered via aerial storm surveys from Pecks Pond east-southeastward to near route 739 in Delaware township.  The average width of the damage path was about 200 yards.     The twister descended once again in the Pecks Pond area around 8:20 pm EDT.  At that point, the intensity was rated as F2 as the tornado cut down nearly every tree in its path on its way towards Blue Heron Lake.  At approximately 8:30 pm, the tornado struck the small vacation community surrounding Blue Heron Lake.  A summer home was leveled by the force of the twister.  The only things left standing were an interior wall and a few sturdy metal cabinets on the floor in the kitchen.  An adjacent mobile home was severely damaged as well.  Two campers near this area had minor injuries from falling tree limbs.  Otherwise, though, injuries were kept to a minimum as homes were mostly vacant.  In addition, an estimated thousands of trees were sheared off or toppled bordering Blue Heron Lake both to the west and east.  The twister's intensity increased at this point to F3.  Further downstream, the tornado continued to cut a consistent path of twisted off and/or uprooted trees across the Little Mud Pond, Silver Lake, and Deer Leap Factory areas.  The tornado appeared to skip across hilltop sections along this route with its intensity mainly in the F1 range.  Finally, just before 8:45 pm EDT, the tornado ascended once again in Delaware township as little in the way of damage was evident between route 739 and the Delaware River.     In all, emergency management and federal officials estimated that in excess of 1 million dollars damage was incurred along this approximately 20 mile path.  Many roads were closed as they became impassable due to fallen trees and wires.  Portions of routes 402 and 390 were closed for several days.  In addition, sections of Promised Land State Park were closed off to the public for about two weeks until all debris was cleared away and power was restored.",PDC

The first severe thunderstorm to affect eastern Oklahoma scraped the northwestern part of Osage County, causing a report of a severe thunderstorm gust.  This storm quickly died as it entered Kansas.A second more serious severe thunderstorm formed west of Oklahoma City and tracked all the way to the Arkansas state line south of Fort Smith, traversing Pittsburg, Haskell, and Le Flore Counties.  This storm travelled east along an instability axis and a warm front.  From a radar perspective, this storm was impressive in that it kept a classic, well-defined hook on its entire journey across southeast Oklahoma.  From a human perspective, this storm was impressive in that it produced ten tornadoes in southeast Oklahoma, hail as large as golfballs, damaging thunderstorm winds, and torrential flooding rains.A third cluster of severe thunderstorms developed over Creek County and moved east across Okmulgee, Muskogee, Cherokee, and Adair Counties before weakening as it entered Arkansas.  These storms slowed their movement across Muskogee County and regeneration along the southwest flank of the storms caused torrential rainfalls that dumped nearly three inches of rain in northern Muskogee, southern Cherokee, southern Adair, and northern Sequoyah Counties.

The most significant storm developed in Washita county at approximately 400 pm CST and intensified as it moved east toward central Oklahoma.  This storm produced at least six tornadoes as it tracked from Canadian County across Oklahoma County during the early evening. The most damaging tornado (an F2)  touched down in northeast Oklahoma City and crossed Interstate 35 near the Frontier City theme park. Other tornadoes damaged the Oklahoma City Boat Club, portions of The Village and Nichols Hills, the Highland Park neighborhood west of Broadway Extension, and the area near May and Grand Avenues in Oklahoma City. Three weak tornadoes also touched down in open country northwest of El Reno and near Yukon. In addition to damaging tornadoes, the storm produced extensive straight-line wind damage from Lake Hefner, across Nichols Hills and The Village, into northeast Oklahoma County. Winds likely exceeded 100 mph in some areas. There were no fatalities and only 21 relatively minor injuries reported in Oklahoma County. The majority of the injuries were sustained at the Frontier City theme park. Earlier, another supercell thunderstorm produced tornadoes near Longdale in Blaine County and 3 miles southwest of Guthrie.  Supercells that tracked across Noble County and northern Cleveland County produced large hail and severe winds, but no tornadoes.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.","This tornado formed near NW 84th Street and Walker and traveled northeast until dissipating immediately east of the Broadway Extension 1/4 mile south of Britton Road.  Total path length was 3/4 mile. Path width approximately 50 yards. This tornado was rated F1(73-112 mph). Along the damage path, a large portion of the roof decking was removed from a home on the southeast corner of 84th and Walker. Street signs also were torn from the ground (not well anchored) at this location. Several vehicles were damaged by flying debris. Minor roof damage occurred to other homes on 84th, 85th, and 86th Streets. On 87th and 88th Streets near Harvey, several homes suffered major roof damage and the western one-half of the New Life Baptist Church was destroyed. A portion of the church roof was thrown southeastward across 88th causing major damage to a home. Failure of the north, west and south walls of the church occurred as the roof lifted off.",PDC

Temperatures in this air were around 90 degrees F.  Dew point temperatures were in the low to mid 70s, making for an unstable situation.  A cold front was poised to the north of Iowa and was sagging southward slowly.  Thunderstorms began to form over central Iowa during the mid afternoon hours.  They formed rather quickly into a cluster of storms, with repeated development in the same areas.  Most of the individual cells were right turning cells and many produced hail.  Numerous reports of hail up to golf ball in size were received from in the Des Moines area, southeast toward Ottumwa.  The cluster of storms that initially formed over central Iowa did eventually drift southeast toward the Ottumwa area just before sunset.  The largest hail report came from Colo in Story County.  Three inch diameter hail covered the ground to a depth of 4 inches between Colo and Collins.  Needless to say, there were many reports of damage to roofs and cars.  Fortunately, the largest hail remained just north and east of the densely populated Des Moines metro area.  During the early stages of the storms development, a couple small tornadoes were reported.  One was in Polk County, while the second was over Marian County.  Both were small and only touched down briefly.  The one over Marian County dipped up and down from the clouds several times during it's brief life span.  No serious damage occurred as the tornadoes touched down in rural areas.  In addition to the hail and tornadoes, the storms produced copious amounts of rainfall.  Reports from the Ankeny area east toward Newton indicated very heavy rainfall from the storms.  The southeast side of Ankeny reported 3.27 inches of rain in less than two hours time.  This resulted in local flooding, however no widespread flooding occurred.",Small tornado with brief touchdown,PDC

The first two storms developed quickly over central Wisconsin and then tracked east-southeast through the Fox Cities. These two storms primarily produced large hail (1 to 2 inches in diameter) and some wind damage. A brief tornado touched down with the first storm near Menasha (Winnebago co.).  The third storm developed farther north in the northeast part of the state. This storm evolved more slowly, but went through the classic life-cycle of a tornadic supercell and spawned an F3 tornado in Door county.Large hail struck the Fox Cities, especially Appleton, producing over $5 million in damage to vehicles and roofs of buildings.  This was the second multi-million dollar hailstorm this year in Appleton.  In Sherwood (Calumet co.), hail damage to a golf course was so severe that it did not open until two days later.  In Brillion (Calumet co.), hail shattered large glass panels of a church.The most severe damage occurred when a tornado tore a path 5.1 miles long and over a half-mile wide across Door county.  The tornado came onshore from Green Bay at Murphy Park, on the Door county west coast at 630 pm.  Thousands of trees were flattened in the heavily wooded area.  About 30 homes, businesses and barns were destroyed or heavily damaged by the storm, but only two minor injuries were reported.  Some livestock, however, including five horses, were lost.  The tornado knocked down seven power poles holding electrical transmission lines, bringing blackouts to most of the north half of Door county.  Thirty adults and 17 children at a campground found refuge in a concrete building as the tornado approached the grounds.  Two minor injuries occurred at the camping resort as it took a direct hit.

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's ""gust front"" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently ""microbursts"" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.  Overall, approximately twelve people sustained injuries and damage was estimated around $16 million.","A tornado touched down 3.5 miles southwest of Williamsfield.  It destroyed a steel corn crib, blew down a large tree which damaged a home.  Also, several windows were blown out on the home.  As the tornado travelled east it caused major tree damage for a mile.  Then it blew a large tree onto another home and destroyed an empty silo.  Next it destroyed a barn and two outbuildings, knocked yet another  tree onto a home, as well as, breaking several windows and blowing several 2x4s into the home.  Further down the road, the roof and east walls of two homes were destroyed.  Then for the last half of a mile, ten power poles were blown down, as well as, numerous trees and a barn sustained moderate damage.  One woman sustained minor injuries from flying glass.

The first severe thunderstorm to affect eastern Oklahoma scraped the northwestern part of Osage County, causing a report of a severe thunderstorm gust.  This storm quickly died as it entered Kansas.A second more serious severe thunderstorm formed west of Oklahoma City and tracked all the way to the Arkansas state line south of Fort Smith, traversing Pittsburg, Haskell, and Le Flore Counties.  This storm travelled east along an instability axis and a warm front.  From a radar perspective, this storm was impressive in that it kept a classic, well-defined hook on its entire journey across southeast Oklahoma.  From a human perspective, this storm was impressive in that it produced ten tornadoes in southeast Oklahoma, hail as large as golfballs, damaging thunderstorm winds, and torrential flooding rains.A third cluster of severe thunderstorms developed over Creek County and moved east across Okmulgee, Muskogee, Cherokee, and Adair Counties before weakening as it entered Arkansas.  These storms slowed their movement across Muskogee County and regeneration along the southwest flank of the storms caused torrential rainfalls that dumped nearly three inches of rain in northern Muskogee, southern Cherokee, southern Adair, and northern Sequoyah Counties.  In addition to flooding rains, these storms produced hail as large as nickels and damaging thunderstorm winds.",,PDC

The most significant storm developed in Washita county at approximately 400 pm CST and intensified as it moved east toward central Oklahoma.  This storm produced at least six tornadoes as it tracked from Canadian County across Oklahoma County during the early evening. The most damaging tornado (an F2)  touched down in northeast Oklahoma City and crossed Interstate 35 near the Frontier City theme park. Other tornadoes damaged the Oklahoma City Boat Club, portions of The Village and Nichols Hills, the Highland Park neighborhood west of Broadway Extension, and the area near May and Grand Avenues in Oklahoma City. Three weak tornadoes also touched down in open country northwest of El Reno and near Yukon. In addition to damaging tornadoes, the storm produced extensive straight-line wind damage from Lake Hefner, across Nichols Hills and The Village, into northeast Oklahoma County. Winds likely exceeded 100 mph in some areas. There were no fatalities and only 21 relatively minor injuries reported in Oklahoma County. The majority of the injuries were sustained at the Frontier City theme park. Earlier, another supercell thunderstorm produced tornadoes near Longdale in Blaine County and 3 miles southwest of Guthrie.  Supercells that tracked across Noble County and northern Cleveland County produced large hail and severe winds, but no tornadoes.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.",A tornado touched down in open country.

The tornadoes were spawned by a single storm between 6 and 715 pm CST in Pottawatomie and Seminole Counties. The first tornado (an F1) touched down 3.5 miles west-southwest of Maud in Pottawatomie County, moved east into Seminole County, lifting about 11 miles west-southwest of Wewoka. The second tornado (rated F2) touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Wewoka in Seminole County, moved east through Wewoka, and crossed into Hughes County.  Meanwhile, the third tornado (also an F2) developed about 4.5 miles west-southwest of Yeager in Hughes County. These two tornadoes then merged about 3.5 miles southwest of Yeager and continued east until they lifted 4 miles east of Yeager.   This tornadic thunderstorm also produced hail as large as softballs southwest of Seminole in Seminole County. Baseball sized hail was reported with a different storm in Oklahoma City in Oklahoma County.  Widespread hail and wind damage occurred in Ponca City in Kay County and in Norman in Cleveland County.Wind gusts were estimated as high as 70 mph near Wellston and Warwick in Lincoln County. Significant thunderstorm wind damage occurred throughout Lincoln County, in Purcell in McClain County, and near Calumet and El Reno in Canadian County.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.","Surveys showed that at about 735 pm, a tornado touched down about 1/2 mile southwest of the intersection of US-270 and SH-59, or about 2.5 miles southwest of Wewoka. The storm moved east through the south side of Wewoka causing damage in a neighborhood in the southwest side of Wewoka and along state highway 56 in the south part of town. The tornado continued moving east destroying two mobile homes southeast of Wewoka before crossing into Hughes County. It caused minor damage to a couple of homes and unroofed a mobile home near State Highway 48. The tornado then turned northeast and apparently merged with the Yeager tornado (see separate Storm Data entry) just northeast of the intersection of State Highway 48 and county road EW129. This tornado was on the ground for 8 miles and had a maximum width of 1/3 of a mile. The tornado was rated F2 (winds estimated between 113 and 157 mph) based on damage in southwest Wewoka including a brick house unroofed and the south exterior wall blown in.

This set the stage for the development of severe weather later that afternoon as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.

The most devastating storms occurred in Pike county.  Within about a 3 hour stretch from 7 to 10 pm EDT, four different twisters affected the county.  One tornadic cell was responsible for knocking down thousands of healthy large trees in and around Promised Land State Park with several vacation homes damaged or leveled.  Fortunately, injuries were kept at a minimum.       Widespread straight line wind damage also occurred with hailstones the size of ping pong balls falling in some places.

Strong upper level dynamics moved over the state over the top of an unstable air mass.  Surface dew point temperatures were in the low 70s with actual temperatures in the upper 70s to low 80s.  CAPE values rose to between 2500 and 3500 J/kg.  The situation became complex during the afternoon as several bands of severe thunderstorms developed.  Some areas of the state were affected three times during the day as the storms raced northeast around 60 MPH.  The main severe feature with the storms was high wind.  There were numerous reports of wind gusts of 60 to 75 MPH.  Some were even higher.  One of the highest reports came from Atlantic in Cass County.  Ninety one MPH winds there threw several cars and a few semi-tractortrailer trucks off of Interstate 80.  High winds in Kossuth County at Algona resulted in roof damage at a nursing home there.  Part of the roof was removed by the winds with the damage estimates to the building places at around $200,000.  Another cluster of storms moved into north central Iowa and caused widespread damage in Cerro Gordo and Worth Counties.  Both were hit with winds around 70 MPH.  There were numerous other reports of damage to farm buildings around the state ranging from corn cribs damaged to barns being destroyed.  Damage to trees and power lines was extensive.  North of Algona, along U.S. Highway 169, seventy eight power poles were downed by the high winds resulting in a four day closure of the highway.  Utility damage around the county was estimated at between $600,000 and $800,000, while insurance adjusters estimated damage around the county at $1.2 million.  There were some reports of hail, especially during the first few hours of the event.  The largest hail was around golf ball in size.  In addition to the wind and hail, there were several tornado touch downs in the state.  A tornado touched down in Kossuth County and did over $1 million in damage.  The tornado destroyed 2 houses with another 10 sustaining major damage.  Fifteen farmsteads were destroyed as well.  Kossuth County was later declared a disaster area.  There was also considerable damage to barns and other farm buildings across the county.  The outflow from the tornadic storm in Kossuth County pushed an 85 MPH wind gust south into Humboldt County.  The high winds blew over 41 railroad cars of the Union Pacific Railroad south of Ottosen.  A band of 80 to 90 MPH winds swept across Franklin and Butler Counties.  Damage was widespread.  There was one report of the wind carrying the family dog over one half mile from home.  The dog was later found safe and healthy.  Another of the stronger tornadoes included one in Wright County that was on the ground for over 10 miles.  It damaged several farm buildings along its path.  Several 2 x 4's were driven into the ground north of Clarion by the tornado.  Another fairly strong tornado touched down in Crawford County.  The rope tornado touched down southeast of Denison.  It hit a train about 3 miles east of Denison and derailed nine cars of the Union Pacific freight train.  The engineer saw it coming and thought it was so small that nothing would happen.  There was also minor damage to 1 house and several out buildings.  There were a few other brief touch downs around the state, however no damage was reported with them.   The rapid movement of the storms prevented a lot of the flooding that would have otherwise occurred.  Repeat thunderstorms passing over Kossuth County did cause some urban flooding.  Damage was relatively minor, however several homes reported minor flooding.  As the storms moved across Hancock County, lightning struck a house in the town of Britt.  The kitchen sink was blown away from the wall and all of the appliances and the electrical equipment in the house was damaged.  Lightning struck very close to another house in Wright County in Belmond.  A 75-year old woman received minor injuries as she was struck by lightning as she unplugged her TV near a large window.",,PDC

Tornado intensities varied from F0 to F3 along this path.  Hailstones as large as baseballs and tea cups were also observed along the cell's southern and western flanks.       A tornado which affected Apalachin in southeastern Tioga county crossed the county line and into the town of Vestal around 5:35 pm EDT.  At this point, the tornado was rated as F0 intensity with the width of the damage path around 70 yards.  Damage was primarily to trees with some large trees uprooted and/or twisted off over hilltop sections.  As the cell moved further east into the town of Binghamton, the tornado intensified to category F2 with the damage width increasing to around 100 yards.  In this location, the damage became increasingly severe with more structures affected.  The local ABC affiliate in the town of Binghamton sustained major damage.  A 1000 foot television tower was twisted and toppled to the ground.  A large trash dumpster was lifted off the ground and tossed into two satellite dishes, then thrown about 100 yards further over an embankment.  A sport utility vehicle was rolled over several times as witnessed by a television crew member.  Another vehicle was also moved and a video tape was carried over a mile and a half away from the station.  Several small trailers were also flattened in Binghamton just east of Ingraham Hill and others had minor roof damage.  Two serious injuries occurred when a trailer collapsed upon the two female occupants who were in the kitchen at the time.      Between approximately 6:20 and 6:45 pm EDT, the tornado moved further east through Conklin, Kirkwood, Windsor, and eventually to the Sanford/Deposit area.  In the towns of Conklin and Kirkwood, the tornado maintained an F2 intensity.  More than a dozen homes took on damage as the twister moved through.  For the majority of these residences, damage was restricted to shingles and/or portions of the siding torn off or damaged from falling trees.  However, there were several trailers that were nearly or completely destroyed within the direct path of the tornado in the town of Conklin.  For one such trailer, its wreckage was strewn downstream for more than a quarter of a mile.  As the twister moved into the town of Windsor, it briefly weakened to F0 intensity.  At that point, touchdown locations appeared to be restriced to a few scattered spots with damage consisting of tree tops snapped or twisted off.     Once the tornado reached the town of Sanford, it reintensified and reached category F3.  A well built house was totally destroyed.  The only part of the structure left standing was a small interior closet.  Also, a wide swath of trees were flattened near a power company sub-station.  Trees were twisted off and blown in all directions with hundreds of them estimated to be toppled.  Local residents observed hail to 3 inches in diameter near the path of the tornado.  Fortunately, as the twister reached its greatest intensity, it affected areas that were more sparsely populated.       In all, county emergency management officials estimated damage totals near 1.5 million dollars.  Dozens of structures were severely damaged or destroyed and thousands of trees were cut down.  Twelve injuries were sustained in total with very fortunately no loss of life.  In some of the more remote areas, it took the better part of a week to restore power.  Two of the three local television affiliates were knocked off the air for a time on the evening of the 31st with several radio stations also suffering through service interruptions for up to three days.  The towns of Binghamton, Conklin, and Sanford were put under a local state of emergency and also ultimately declared federal disaster areas.",PDC

Hail reports indicated frequent baseball size hail with a few reports to softball size and larger.  The largest report was an incredible 5 inch diameter stone north of Gilbert in Story County.  The damage caused was incredible.  In some town, every north facing window was broken out by the hail.  On one building, the hail was so large that it broke the stone tile roof in the building, smashing it into pieces.  Property damage was extensive in a swath from Sac County through Marshall County.  Total property damage was estimated to be well in excess of $5,000,000.  In Calhoun County, the town of Lohrville was hard hit by baseball size hail.  Damage in the town was estimated at $1 million as the hail knocked out windows in almost all of the 225 buildings in town.  One injury was reported in Lohrville as a woman was treated for an eye injury as shards of glass flew into her eye from a car windshield broken by the hail.

The first severe thunderstorm to affect eastern Oklahoma scraped the northwestern part of Osage County, causing a report of a severe thunderstorm gust.  This storm quickly died as it entered Kansas.A second more serious severe thunderstorm formed west of Oklahoma City and tracked all the way to the Arkansas state line south of Fort Smith, traversing Pittsburg, Haskell, and Le Flore Counties.  This storm travelled east along an instability axis and a warm front.  From a radar perspective, this storm was impressive in that it kept a classic, well-defined hook on its entire journey across southeast Oklahoma.  From a human perspective, this storm was impressive in that it produced ten tornadoes in southeast Oklahoma, hail as large as golfballs, damaging thunderstorm winds, and torrential flooding rains.A third cluster of severe thunderstorms developed over Creek County and moved east across Okmulgee, Muskogee, Cherokee, and Adair Counties before weakening as it entered Arkansas.  These storms slowed their movement across Muskogee County and regeneration along the southwest flank of the storms caused torrential rainfalls that dumped nearly three inches of rain in northern Muskogee, southern Cherokee, southern Adair, and northern Sequoyah Counties.

This set the stage for severe weather that afternoon and evening as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From early in the afternoon until the evening hours, central New York was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, six separate tornadoes touched down on this day in central New York.  The most devastating twister cut a discontinuous sixty plus mile track from southeastern Tioga county across southern Broome county and into Delaware county where it finally lifted back into the cloud base.  This tornado alone damaged or destroyed more than 30 homes and injured nearly 20 people.  Very fortunately, no fatalities occurred.  Another violent tornado ripped through southern sections of Otsego county between Laurens and Milford.  Thousands of trees were snapped off or uprooted with large sections of forest completely taken out.  Several residences were leveled and many roads were impassable for days due to the fallen debris.  The damage toll from this day's tornadoes ran into the millions.     Several strong bow echo complexes also affected central New York.  From southern Chenango county through the lower half of Otsego county, one such storm took out hundreds of trees and inflicted considerable structural damage in and around Oneonta.  One man was killed in Oneonta when hit by a falling tree limb.  Throughout Onondaga county, wind gusts estimated at 90 to 100 mph caused widespread damage early in the evening between 6:00 and 6:30 pm EDT.

Hail as large as 3 to 4 inches in diameter accompanied some of the tornadic supercells across New York's southern tier; smashing windows, severely denting cars, and causing crop losses.

Overall, downed trees and power lines and lightning strikes knocked out power to 22,000 in southern Michigan, most of which occurred in Barry, Calhoun, and Wayne Counties (in southeast Lower Michigan).","Damage surveys conducted by the National Weather Service with the assistance of the Civil Air Patrol and Calhoun County Emergency Management confirmed a brief tornado touchdown occurred in Bedford Township of northwest Calhoun County at 4:34 pm EDT on Friday, June 12th. The tornado touched down in a low wooded area near Kirby Lake, 2 miles southwest of the village of Bedford. The tornado crossed Collier Road and travelled along Halbert Road and caused extensive damage to trees from Wanbascon Creek to about 3/4 of a mile east of Michigan Highway 37. The storm path length was approximately 2.5 statute miles long and up to 600 feet (or 200 yards) wide. It appeared that most of the tornadic winds remained aloft, clipping the upper half of trees like a large weed wacker. Scattered homes in the area received minor damage consisting of broken windows, TV antennas bent over roof tops, and damage to shingles and siding. A few homes sustained roof damage as the result of trees and large limbs being blown down on the dwellings. Based on the estimates from the damage survey in Bedford Township, this particular tornado was rated F1 (73-112mph) on the Fujita Scale. The tornado lifted approximately 4 minutes after touching down as the storm continued to move east-southeast into Pennfield Township. No injuries or fatalities were reported as a direct result of this tornado touchdown. Parts of Michigan Highway 37 were closed for a time after the storm to clear away downed trees and power lines.",PDC

The air mass ahead of the front was quite unstable with surface dew point temperatures around 60 degrees.  Deep moisture was in place across the state.  An upper level disturbance moved northeast along the front and set off thunderstorms in the vicinity of the cold front.  The storms raced northeast at nearly 60 MPH.  The main weather threat with the storms was hail with numerous reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail.  Hail covered the ground south of Waterloo.  Hail of nearly golf ball size fell just west of Des Moines near Waukee.  Though there were gusty winds associated with the storms, very few locations reported severe winds.  There were several reports of high winds over southeast Iowa.  Most of the wind reports came from Wapello, Mahaska, and Davis Counties.  One report of 60 MPH winds was received in Wapello County at Eddyville.  Winds of 70 MPH were reported over eastern Davis County, where a barn was destroyed, and in Mahaska County where damage occurred in New Sharon.  The line of storms did produce one tornado.

Dew point temperatures were approaching 80 degrees F. over a large part of Iowa.  Initially, a line of thunderstorms developed from southwest Minnesota, southwest into Nebraska.  This line progressed southeast during the evening.  A couple of things happened during the mid evening hours.  The first was the formation of a line of thunderstorms from west central Iowa into central Iowa.  The storms produced winds of up to 65 MPH as they moved across Audubon County during the initial development stage.  The storms formed along a convergence zone and were slow moving.  The second was an acceleration of the line moving in from the west as a speed max approached.  During the mid and late evening hours, the portion of the northeast to southwest oriented line over northwest Iowa turned into a bow echo and raced southeast across the state.  A small tornado touched down in Carroll County.  The main severe weather feature with the storms was high winds as the bow echo advanced south and east across Iowa.  Winds of 60 to 70 MPH were common along the line.  Numerous trees and power lines were downed by the winds.  The winds resulted in scattered power outages, the worst of which was in the Des Moines metropolitan area where 9000 were without power for several hours after the storms passed.  The other problem was with flooding.  The main problem was with the northwest to southeast oriented line since it was very slow moving.  The airmass being fairly tropical in nature resulted in large amounts of rainfall over several counties.  Flash flooding occurred in Dallas, Polk, and Guthrie Counties.  Widespread rainfall of 2 to 3 inches occurred, with some areas receiving around 5 inches.  Much of the rain fell in about an hour, causing very rapid rises in streams as the ground was saturated at the time it rained.  In Guthrie County, evacuations took place in the Lake Panorama area as water overtopped the dam there.  Rainfall of 2 to 5 inches occurred in Sac, Carroll, and Greene Counties.  This resulted in fairly widespread urban flooding, however rainfall in these areas took several hours to fall and with soils there not as saturated, flooding was not as serious.  As the storms moved through Black Hawk County, lightning struck a house in Cedar Falls.  Though no serious damage occurred, appliances were damaged and the window frame of one window was blown out.  Shreds of the frame flew across the room as the lightning struck.",,PDC

The warm front had moved to the northern Iowa border during the afternoon of the 27th with dew point temperatures in the mid 70s to around 80 blanketing the state in the warm sector.  Initially, the airmass was capped, preventing thunderstorms from forming during the afternoon.  Slightly cooler air moved in during the evening hours.  In addition to the slightly cooler air moving in aloft, a cold front was poised over eastern Nebraska ready to move east into the state.  Thunderstorms erupted rapidly by early evening with hail and high winds reported over northern Iowa.  There were numerous reports of hail of an inch or larger in diameter, with a few reports of golf ball size hail.  High winds were also a problem with many of the storms producing 60 to 70 MPH wind gusts.  Reports of tree and power line damage were widespread.  There were a few tornadoes as well.  One tracked across open country in Cerro Gordo County before damaging a house south of Clear Lake.  Another tornado touched down near Swaledale in Cerro Gordo County and passed southeast of Mason City.  Much of the track was over open country, however one house was destroyed near Swaledale by this tornado.  The longest track tornado moved across Butler and Bremer Counties.  It also passed through open country, causing damage to crops and out buildings.  In addition to these, there were a few brief touchdowns reported.  Iowa soil remained very saturated with numerous rivers at or near flood stage.  Heavy rainfall of near 4 inches in a couple hours time caused flash flooding in Cerro Gordo County.  A widespread area of north central into northeast Iowa received heavy rainfall.  Many areas picked up two to four inches of rain in a few hour period.  This resulted in urban and small stream flooding, and ultimately general river flooding in the days that followed.  As the storms moved through Worth County, lightning struck an outbuilding west of Kensett.  The building was set on fire and destroyed.",,PDC

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's ""gust front"" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently ""microbursts"" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.  Overall, approximately twelve people sustained injuries and damage was estimated around $16 million.","A tornado briefly touched down in Tolono on the west side near the park.

The episode was highlighted by supercell thunderstorms which produced two multi-county tornadoes and several instances of large hail.  For many residents of the Potomac highlands, the storms were a watershed event; the locals believed that tornadoes ""like those in the midwest and Great Plains"" could never strike.The first twister, originally associated with a supercell which had produced a long (11-13 mile track) tornado in Somerset Co, Pennsylvania, re-emerged in extreme northeastern Mineral Co just east of Wagoner.  The storm crossed into Hampshire Co, then passed an Allegheny Power substation before causing minor damage at some homes just north of Donaldson.  Damage included a destroyed gazebo, stripped siding/trim from homes, and several uprooted or snapped trees.  The tornado crossed River Mountain, causing damage primarily to forested areas.  The path continued across the South Branch of the Potomac River before the tornado dissipated just outside the town of Levels.The second tornado produced significantly more property damage.  Initial reports of a funnel cloud over Bloomington, Maryland (Garrett Co) became prophetic as the first touchdown occurred 5 miles southwest of Keyser.  Damage increased as the storm descended the Allegheny front range (Green Mountain).  A car was blown over, a garage destroyed, and several trees were snapped or uprooted.  A pine tree landed on one home, another home sustained minor damage, and a nearby mobile home had its skirting blown off.The twister crossed New Creek Mountain, levelling numerous trees in heavily forested areas.  Damage intensified after the tornado descended the mountain.  One mobile home was destroyed - and, after the storm crossed federal highway 220, more tree damage was noted, as was minor damage to homes and extensive damage to outbuildings.  The storm continued along federal highway(s) 50/220 to Ridgeville, rolling one mobile home, causing minor damage to nearby buildings, and destroying a barn near the Mill Creek Country Club just west of Burlington.  From there, the tornado continued over Patterson Creek Mountain and into Hampshire Co, where several mobile homes were damaged or rolled along Davy Road.  Five persons in one of the homes sustained minor injuries; only one accepted transport to a local hospital for head trauma.  A station wagon was completely turned around and sustained minor damage.  The twister then tracked three miles south of Junction, where it likely dissipated.Hail was associated with each mini-supercell - and several residents, including fruit farmers, noted varying amounts of damage due to prolonged and, in some cases, sizeable hail.

Initially, the surface warm front was located to the south of this system.  That was not actually the case aloft however.  During the predawn hours the surface front surged north and by sunrise was located across northeast Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable to the south of the front with dew point temperatures will in the 70s F.  The initial development of thunderstorms took place during the early part of the day over northeast Nebraska.  The storms became severe quickly as they moved and developed eastward into Iowa.  By mid morning, the storms had formed a nearly east to west line.  Storm relative inflow into the line was around 40 knots.  The storms produced a variety of severe weather across Iowa.  They initially moved east across the northern and central counties, but then began sinking sinking southeast.  The dominant severe weather with the storms was extremely high winds.  Damage was very widespread across the state.  Winds in excess of 100 MPH were reported with one unofficial wind speed measured at 126 MPH in the town of Washington at 1405 CST.  In one unusual story, high winds hit Mahaska County.  Three miles south of New Sharon, a puppy was tied to its dog house which was picked up by the wind.  The dog house and puppy were lifted over the top of a two car garage and a corn crib.  Both were deposited in the farm yard.  When found the dog house was upside down and the puppy, though scared, was fine.  There were several tornadoes during the event.  One of the longer track well defined tornadoes was the initial tornado.  It was on the ground for about 11 miles as it swept across Crawford County.  Several residences, outbuildings, grain bins, and trees were damaged along its path.  Reports indicate that between 30 and 50 residences were damaged by this tornado.  There were several small tornadoes in central Iowa.  They had short tracks and only touched down briefly.  One cut a mile long path east of Marshalltown through a corn field and a grove of trees.  Another in Dallas County was on the ground through mostly open country for two miles.  High winds were a major problem with these storms.  Many places reported winds over 80 MPH with incredible tree damage and numerous buildings damaged or destroyed.  At least 38 counties were declared disaster areas by the Federal Government due to the severe damage and flooding.  A final total will not be available before publication deadlines, however preliminary data have been included.  In the Des Moines County Warning Area these included:  Wright, Franklin, Butler, Bremer, Hamilton, Hardin, Grundy, Crawford, Carroll, Greene, Boone, Story, Marshall,  Audubon, Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Jasper, Cass, Adair, Madison, Warren, Marion, Adams, and Taylor.  One of the hardest hit Counties was Polk County.  Damage appeared to be from straight line winds based on a storm survey that was done following the event.  The damage occurred over the southwest semicircle of a large meso low in contact with the ground.  Due to the rapid translational speed of 50 to 75 MPH, winds were enhanced on the southwest semicircle of the meso low.  Smaller scale winds could have been embedded within this circulation as well.  There was little evidence of small scale convergent tornadic damage, however aerial surveys did make some suggestion and eye witness accounts of sightings were quite numerous in the metro Des Moines area.  All trees and debris were laid down to the south or southeast.  The major damage swath as 3 to 7 miles wide northwest of Camp Dodge, with a widening into a full blown derecho after that.  The event was born a few miles northwest of Perry, between Rippey and Berkley in southwest Boone County.  The mile wide damage path expanded to over 3 miles by the time it reached full intensity near highway 169 between Woodward and Perry.  The path continued through Granger, Camp Dodge, and Johnston.  The path was nearly 7 miles wide near Granger.  A second, smaller, meso low passed near Madrid, downing power lines.  This meso low matured near Jester Park Golf Course, causing significant structural damage to houses.  The two meso lows merged near the NWS Forecast Office in Johnston, with two miles of power poles snapped off between Johnston and Granger.  Much of the damage along the most severe track was in the F1 intensity category, with speeds in the 75 to 110 MPH range.  A few spots along the path, such as in the Granger and Camp Dodge area, sustained sufficient damage to justify F2 winds, 110 to 155 MPH.  It appears a tornado or family of tornadoes touched down southeast of Berkley and moved southeast into the Pleasant Hill area just east of Des Moines.  The track was intermittent, indicating either one tornado touching down occasionally, or one or more weak tornadoes rotating around the meso circulation.  The worst effected metro areas were the Granger area, Johnston, and the northeast side of Des Moines proper.  A duplex in Granger was flattened by the winds.  There were several reports of roofs being ripped off of stores and houses in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Several small private planes were flipped at a small air field north of Des Moines.  There were also several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being blown over on Interstate 35.  Heavy construction equipment was overturned on Interstate 35/80 just north of Des Moines.  Damage was extensive to the east side of Des Moines proper.  To make matters worse, following the passage of the main line of thunderstorms, a second line of severe thunderstorms developed and moved across the same areas already hit.  The storms were smaller, but did produce brief tornado touch downs and hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter.  The second line of storms did eventually combine with the first and moved southeast across the rest of the state.  Damage was widespread across the state and it will be months before final numbers are in.  Estimates from Polk County alone are near $100 million in damage including cleanup.  Totals were still being tallied at this writing, however a few include over $11 million in damage from initial claims in Johnston and $726,000 from West Des Moines just to city buildings and systems.  West Des Moines was on the far west edge of the major damage however.  In addition to the property damage, at least 125 people were injured during the storm.  Most of the injuries were caused by flying debris and many were not serious.  Fortunately there were no fatalities.  Heavy damage was reported by MidAmerica Energy.  On a state wide report, they indicated 200,000 homes  were without electricity, effecting over 500,000 people, at one time during the storm.  In the metropolitan Des Moines area, 100,000 homes were without electricity at the height of the storm.  That number was reduced to around 25,000 36 hours later.  The worst damaged areas were without power for 5 to 6 days.  Heavy damage was also reported by local telephone and cable systems.  In Polk County, the worst damage extended from the Camp Dodge area into the northeast parts of Des Moines.  At least 462 homes in the metro Des Moines area sustained significant damage.  Statewide, 80 homes were destroyed, 559 sustained severe damage, with 1416 others receiving moderate damage.  In the Camp Dodge area, 80 to 90 percent of the brick buildings were damaged with the roofs removed from many of them.  Lightning from the storms struck the WSR-88D in the midst of the storm.  The radar was taken out of service for more than 24 hours because of this.  In addition to the severe weather, flooding quickly became a problem.  Iowa soil was nearly saturated as the weather pattern had been very wet for six weeks previous.  Although rainfall was not extreme, one to three inches of rain fell over a several county area.  This caused widespread urban flooding across north central into central Iowa, though damage from the flooding was not serious.  Crop damage was very difficult to determine and will not likely be clear until the fall harvest.  Reports from some of the local extension agents say damage to the corn ranged up to 75% destroyed in areas with the highest wind, such as the swath that went through central Iowa in association with the tornado there.  No doubt losses will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not in the millions.   Accounts of damage were of course too numerous to document here as the areal extent of the storms was very large.  Countless reports of parts of crop fields being flattened were received.  Semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned by the high winds both in the Des Moines metro area as well as in Newton.  Trees were found on houses over a large part of the state.  One news reported wrote ""there is not a power pole standing between Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa"".  Though not figuratively true, this statement does point out the extensive damage that occurred with these storms.l",,PDC

Casualties in south Florida included two drownings in a fishing boat that capsized near the Dry Tortugas and about 65 injuries, most of them minor, in the upper keys involving hurricane spawned tornadoes.  Losses are estimated at $50 million, including $20 million in crop damage. Much of the property damage was caused by five tornadoes, one of which reached a maximum intensity of F2, in the upper Keys.  A total of 646 dwellings were damaged in an area from Islamorada to north Key Largo.  Other tornadoes were observed in Broward, Palm Beach, and Collier counties. Widespread rainfall totals across south Florida averaged 6 to 8 inches with local amounts of 13 inches. The storm surge of 2 to 4 feet along the Keys and southwest Florida coast, and 1 to 2 feet along the southeast coast, produced minor flooding, beach erosion and damage to marine structures and vessels.  The maximum officially measured wind in south Florida was 52 knots (60 mph) with a peak wind of 57 knots (65 mph) at Fowey Rocks Light. The maximum wind on land was 35 knots (40 mph) with a peak wind of 48 knots (55 mph) at Key West International Airport. About 50,000 customers lost their electricity.","A tornado moved ashore from the Straits of Florida into the middle Keys near mile marker 80.

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's ""gust front"" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently ""microbursts"" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.  Overall, approximately twelve people sustained injuries and damage was estimated around $16 million.",An off-duty police officer witnessed a tornado briefly touch down and pull a large tree out of the ground in the Huntington Heights subdivision 7 miles south of Springfield.

This storm travelled east along an instability axis and a warm front.  From a radar perspective, this storm was impressive in that it kept a classic, well-defined hook on its entire journey across southeast Oklahoma.  From a human perspective, this storm was impressive in that it produced ten tornadoes in southeast Oklahoma, hail as large as golfballs, damaging thunderstorm winds, and torrential flooding rains.A third cluster of severe thunderstorms developed over Creek County and moved east across Okmulgee, Muskogee, Cherokee, and Adair Counties before weakening as it entered Arkansas.  These storms slowed their movement across Muskogee County and regeneration along the southwest flank of the storms caused torrential rainfalls that dumped nearly three inches of rain in northern Muskogee, southern Cherokee, southern Adair, and northern Sequoyah Counties.

This time around, a cold front aided in triggering the episode, though upper-level wind shear was a major player in destabilizing the atmosphere much like it had done the previous day.  Incredibly, the 16th would be the third out of four afternoons that severe weather had occurred in some portion of northern and western Virginia.A comma-shaped line of thunderstorms - indicative of a mesoscale low pressure system - developed by the middle of the afternoon.  The comma ""head"" curled from eastern West Virginia into western Maryland, then formed a line through western and central Virginia.  Several tornadoes touched down in the vicinity of the comma head, from extreme northwestern Virginia through eastern West Virginia and northern and western Maryland; along the comma tail, individual cells produced large hail with some damaging wind gusts.Damage to trees and wires occurred in many areas but, overall, was not quite as substantial when compared to that of the 13th.  Nevertheless, several trees were uprooted, including one which fell onto an automobile, between Harrisonburg and Broadway (Rockingham Co).  Numerous trees were reported down near Craigsville (Augusta Co).  Farther east, trees were down in portions of Fauquier, Loudoun, and Prince William Cos.  A late storm produced damaging winds across much of Highland Co; numerous trees and wires were knocked down.A small tornado struck in and northeast of Clear Brook (northeast Frederick Co), uprooting at least 7 maple trees, smashing a storm window, flattening a barn, and snapping or uprooting 24 additional trees along Grace Church Road.  The parent thunderstorm would continue into eastern West Virginia and western Maryland, producing additional tornadoes.  Allegheny Power reported 2300 customers lost electricity in Frederick Co alone.  Another small tornado touched down in Lovettsville, causing structural damage at one residence and felling numerous trees in a 200-300 ft. wide path.  Straight-line wind damage (mainly to trees) was also noted in other areas of northwestern Loudoun Co.The main severe weather culprit this day was large hail.  Hailstones the size of baseballs dented cars, broke vehicle windows, and stripped paint and siding in portions of Madison, Augusta, Albemarle, Greene, and Culpeper Cos.  In general, hail ranged from 1 to 2.75 inches in diameter.  There were likely dozens of crop fields which sustained losses; a few residential gardens were wiped out by the large hail, which lasted 5 minutes or more in some locations.Lightning also caused some damage.  A home was set afire in Loudoun Co, causing an estimated $200 thousand in damage.  A security guard at Fort Belvoir (southern Fairfax Co) was shocked while opening a metal door; he was treated and released from the Army community hospital after slight numbness ensued.  Other lightning damage was noted in Fredericksburg; one home was struck, sustaining minor damage; there were several instances of personal electronics equipment failures (as reported by a local repair shop).Power outages were widespread; in all, Virginia Power reported approximately 64,000 customers without electricity in northern and western Virginia; Allegheny Power and several rural electric co-operatives reported at least 3,000 additional outages.",,PDC

This set the stage for the development of severe weather later that afternoon as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From late in the afternoon until late that evening, northeastern Pennsylvania was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, nine separate tornadoes touched down on this day.  Overall damage estimates run into the millions with many homes and structures heavily damaged or destroyed.  The most devastating storms occurred in Pike county.  Within about a 3 hour stretch from 7 to 10 pm EDT, four different twisters affected the county.  One tornadic cell was responsible for knocking down thousands of healthy large trees in and around Promised Land State Park with several vacation homes damaged or leveled.  Fortunately, injuries were kept at a minimum.       Widespread straight line wind damage also occurred with hailstones the size of ping pong balls falling in some places.  The north side of Scranton had extensive wind damage as a storm passed through shortly before 10 pm EDT and sections of Wayne and Luzerne counties had roads closed and/or blocked from falling trees for more than 2 days after the storm.  Pennsylvania Power and Light Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power at the height of the storms on the evening of the 31st.

They formed rather quickly into a cluster of storms, with repeated development in the same areas.  Most of the individual cells were right turning cells and many produced hail.  Numerous reports of hail up to golf ball in size were received from in the Des Moines area, southeast toward Ottumwa.  The cluster of storms that initially formed over central Iowa did eventually drift southeast toward the Ottumwa area just before sunset.  The largest hail report came from Colo in Story County.  Three inch diameter hail covered the ground to a depth of 4 inches between Colo and Collins.  Needless to say, there were many reports of damage to roofs and cars.  Fortunately, the largest hail remained just north and east of the densely populated Des Moines metro area.  During the early stages of the storms development, a couple small tornadoes were reported.  One was in Polk County, while the second was over Marian County.  Both were small and only touched down briefly.  The one over Marian County dipped up and down from the clouds several times during it's brief life span.  No serious damage occurred as the tornadoes touched down in rural areas.  In addition to the hail and tornadoes, the storms produced copious amounts of rainfall.  Reports from the Ankeny area east toward Newton indicated very heavy rainfall from the storms.  The southeast side of Ankeny reported 3.27 inches of rain in less than two hours time.  This resulted in local flooding, however no widespread flooding occurred.",Small tornado with numerous brief touchdowns,PDC

This time around, a cold front aided in triggering the episode, though upper-level wind shear was a major player in destabilizing the atmosphere much like it had done the previous day.  Incredibly, the 16th would be the third out of four afternoons that severe weather had occurred in some portion of northern and western Virginia.A comma-shaped line of thunderstorms - indicative of a mesoscale low pressure system - developed by the middle of the afternoon.  The comma ""head"" curled from eastern West Virginia into western Maryland, then formed a line through western and central Virginia.  Several tornadoes touched down in the vicinity of the comma head, from extreme northwestern Virginia through eastern West Virginia and northern and western Maryland; along the comma tail, individual cells produced large hail with some damaging wind gusts.Damage to trees and wires occurred in many areas but, overall, was not quite as substantial when compared to that of the 13th.  Nevertheless, several trees were uprooted, including one which fell onto an automobile, between Harrisonburg and Broadway (Rockingham Co).  Numerous trees were reported down near Craigsville (Augusta Co).  Farther east, trees were down in portions of Fauquier, Loudoun, and Prince William Cos.  A late storm produced damaging winds across much of Highland Co; numerous trees and wires were knocked down.A small tornado struck in and northeast of Clear Brook (northeast Frederick Co), uprooting at least 7 maple trees, smashing a storm window, flattening a barn, and snapping or uprooting 24 additional trees along Grace Church Road.  The parent thunderstorm would continue into eastern West Virginia and western Maryland, producing additional tornadoes.  Allegheny Power reported 2300 customers lost electricity in Frederick Co alone.  Another small tornado touched down in Lovettsville, causing structural damage at one residence and felling numerous trees in a 200-300 ft. wide path.  Straight-line wind damage (mainly to trees) was also noted in other areas of northwestern Loudoun Co.The main severe weather culprit this day was large hail.  Hailstones the size of baseballs dented cars, broke vehicle windows, and stripped paint and siding in portions of Madison, Augusta, Albemarle, Greene, and Culpeper Cos.  In general, hail ranged from 1 to 2.75 inches in diameter.  There were likely dozens of crop fields which sustained losses; a few residential gardens were wiped out by the large hail, which lasted 5 minutes or more in some locations.Lightning also caused some damage.  A home was set afire in Loudoun Co, causing an estimated $200 thousand in damage.  A security guard at Fort Belvoir (southern Fairfax Co) was shocked while opening a metal door; he was treated and released from the Army community hospital after slight numbness ensued.  Other lightning damage was noted in Fredericksburg; one home was struck, sustaining minor damage; there were several instances of personal electronics equipment failures (as reported by a local repair shop).Power outages were widespread; in all, Virginia Power reported approximately 64,000 customers without electricity in northern and western Virginia; Allegheny Power and several rural electric co-operatives reported at least 3,000 additional outages.",,PDC

The first severe thunderstorm to affect eastern Oklahoma scraped the northwestern part of Osage County, causing a report of a severe thunderstorm gust.  This storm quickly died as it entered Kansas.A second more serious severe thunderstorm formed west of Oklahoma City and tracked all the way to the Arkansas state line south of Fort Smith, traversing Pittsburg, Haskell, and Le Flore Counties.  This storm travelled east along an instability axis and a warm front.  From a radar perspective, this storm was impressive in that it kept a classic, well-defined hook on its entire journey across southeast Oklahoma.  From a human perspective, this storm was impressive in that it produced ten tornadoes in southeast Oklahoma, hail as large as golfballs, damaging thunderstorm winds, and torrential flooding rains.A third cluster of severe thunderstorms developed over Creek County and moved east across Okmulgee, Muskogee, Cherokee, and Adair Counties before weakening as it entered Arkansas.  These storms slowed their movement across Muskogee County and regeneration along the southwest flank of the storms caused torrential rainfalls that dumped nearly three inches of rain in northern Muskogee, southern Cherokee, southern Adair, and northern Sequoyah Counties.  In addition to flooding rains, these storms produced hail as large as nickels and damaging thunderstorm winds.",,PDC

It also flipped a trailer, moved a hay wagon, blew out doors to a hangar, and damaged a cinder block outbuilding.This was the second tornado associated with the parent thunderstorm.  The first, perhaps a continuation of one that had struck in extreme northern Frederick Co Virginia moments earlier, cut a brief path across extreme southern Berkeley Co near Ridgeway.  Several trees were blown down, including one onto a mobile home and two more onto nearby homes.  Interestingly, this same storm would spawn three more tornadoes in Washington Co, Maryland, a bit later.In southeastern Jefferson Co, trees were knocked down along federal highway 340 near Harpers Ferry and along state route 9 just east of the Shenandoah River.",,PDC

The first severe thunderstorm to affect eastern Oklahoma scraped the northwestern part of Osage County, causing a report of a severe thunderstorm gust.  This storm quickly died as it entered Kansas.A second more serious severe thunderstorm formed west of Oklahoma City and tracked all the way to the Arkansas state line south of Fort Smith, traversing Pittsburg, Haskell, and Le Flore Counties.  This storm travelled east along an instability axis and a warm front.  From a radar perspective, this storm was impressive in that it kept a classic, well-defined hook on its entire journey across southeast Oklahoma.  From a human perspective, this storm was impressive in that it produced ten tornadoes in southeast Oklahoma, hail as large as golfballs, damaging thunderstorm winds, and torrential flooding rains.A third cluster of severe thunderstorms developed over Creek County and moved east across Okmulgee, Muskogee, Cherokee, and Adair Counties before weakening as it entered Arkansas.  These storms slowed their movement across Muskogee County and regeneration along the southwest flank of the storms caused torrential rainfalls that dumped nearly three inches of rain in northern Muskogee, southern Cherokee, southern Adair, and northern Sequoyah Counties.  In addition to flooding rains, these storms produced hail as large as nickels and damaging thunderstorm winds.","An F2 tornado destroyed one single family dwelling, while another single family dwelling received major damage.",PDC

This set the stage for the development of severe weather later that afternoon as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From late in the afternoon until late that evening, northeastern Pennsylvania was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, nine separate tornadoes touched down on this day.  Overall damage estimates run into the millions with many homes and structures heavily damaged or destroyed.  The most devastating storms occurred in Pike county.  Within about a 3 hour stretch from 7 to 10 pm EDT, four different twisters affected the county.  One tornadic cell was responsible for knocking down thousands of healthy large trees in and around Promised Land State Park with several vacation homes damaged or leveled.  Fortunately, injuries were kept at a minimum.       Widespread straight line wind damage also occurred with hailstones the size of ping pong balls falling in some places.  The north side of Scranton had extensive wind damage as a storm passed through shortly before 10 pm EDT and sections of Wayne and Luzerne counties had roads closed and/or blocked from falling trees for more than 2 days after the storm.  Pennsylvania Power and Light Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power at the height of the storms on the evening of the 31st.

This system dragged a warm front northeastward across central New York.  A southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for severe weather that afternoon and evening as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From early in the afternoon until the evening hours, central New York was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, six separate tornadoes touched down on this day in central New York.  The most devastating twister cut a discontinuous sixty plus mile track from southeastern Tioga county across southern Broome county and into Delaware county where it finally lifted back into the cloud base.  This tornado alone damaged or destroyed more than 30 homes and injured nearly 20 people.  Very fortunately, no fatalities occurred.  Another violent tornado ripped through southern sections of Otsego county between Laurens and Milford.  Thousands of trees were snapped off or uprooted with large sections of forest completely taken out.  Several residences were leveled and many roads were impassable for days due to the fallen debris.  The damage toll from this day's tornadoes ran into the millions.     Several strong bow echo complexes also affected central New York.  From southern Chenango county through the lower half of Otsego county, one such storm took out hundreds of trees and inflicted considerable structural damage in and around Oneonta.  One man was killed in Oneonta when hit by a falling tree limb.  Throughout Onondaga county, wind gusts estimated at 90 to 100 mph caused widespread damage early in the evening between 6:00 and 6:30 pm EDT.  Two large transmission towers near Nedrow were toppled from the winds and many buildings had blown out windows and/or roof damage.     Hail as large as 3 to 4 inches in diameter accompanied some of the tornadic supercells across New York's southern tier; smashing windows, severely denting cars, and causing crop losses.  New York State Electric and Gas Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power during the height of the storms late that afternoon and evening.  Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.","A supercell thunderstorm became tornadic near Plymouth Reservoir in Plymouth township around 5:50 pm EDT.

Initially, the surface warm front was located to the south of this system.  That was not actually the case aloft however.  During the predawn hours the surface front surged north and by sunrise was located across northeast Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable to the south of the front with dew point temperatures will in the 70s F.  The initial development of thunderstorms took place during the early part of the day over northeast Nebraska.  The storms became severe quickly as they moved and developed eastward into Iowa.  By mid morning, the storms had formed a nearly east to west line.  Storm relative inflow into the line was around 40 knots.  The storms produced a variety of severe weather across Iowa.  They initially moved east across the northern and central counties, but then began sinking sinking southeast.  The dominant severe weather with the storms was extremely high winds.  Damage was very widespread across the state.  Winds in excess of 100 MPH were reported with one unofficial wind speed measured at 126 MPH in the town of Washington at 1405 CST.  In one unusual story, high winds hit Mahaska County.  Three miles south of New Sharon, a puppy was tied to its dog house which was picked up by the wind.  The dog house and puppy were lifted over the top of a two car garage and a corn crib.  Both were deposited in the farm yard.  When found the dog house was upside down and the puppy, though scared, was fine.  There were several tornadoes during the event.  One of the longer track well defined tornadoes was the initial tornado.  It was on the ground for about 11 miles as it swept across Crawford County.  Several residences, outbuildings, grain bins, and trees were damaged along its path.  Reports indicate that between 30 and 50 residences were damaged by this tornado.  There were several small tornadoes in central Iowa.  They had short tracks and only touched down briefly.  One cut a mile long path east of Marshalltown through a corn field and a grove of trees.  Another in Dallas County was on the ground through mostly open country for two miles.  High winds were a major problem with these storms.  Many places reported winds over 80 MPH with incredible tree damage and numerous buildings damaged or destroyed.  At least 38 counties were declared disaster areas by the Federal Government due to the severe damage and flooding.  A final total will not be available before publication deadlines, however preliminary data have been included.  In the Des Moines County Warning Area these included:  Wright, Franklin, Butler, Bremer, Hamilton, Hardin, Grundy, Crawford, Carroll, Greene, Boone, Story, Marshall,  Audubon, Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Jasper, Cass, Adair, Madison, Warren, Marion, Adams, and Taylor.  One of the hardest hit Counties was Polk County.  Damage appeared to be from straight line winds based on a storm survey that was done following the event.  The damage occurred over the southwest semicircle of a large meso low in contact with the ground.  Due to the rapid translational speed of 50 to 75 MPH, winds were enhanced on the southwest semicircle of the meso low.  Smaller scale winds could have been embedded within this circulation as well.  There was little evidence of small scale convergent tornadic damage, however aerial surveys did make some suggestion and eye witness accounts of sightings were quite numerous in the metro Des Moines area.  All trees and debris were laid down to the south or southeast.  The major damage swath as 3 to 7 miles wide northwest of Camp Dodge, with a widening into a full blown derecho after that.  The event was born a few miles northwest of Perry, between Rippey and Berkley in southwest Boone County.  The mile wide damage path expanded to over 3 miles by the time it reached full intensity near highway 169 between Woodward and Perry.  The path continued through Granger, Camp Dodge, and Johnston.  The path was nearly 7 miles wide near Granger.  A second, smaller, meso low passed near Madrid, downing power lines.  This meso low matured near Jester Park Golf Course, causing significant structural damage to houses.  The two meso lows merged near the NWS Forecast Office in Johnston, with two miles of power poles snapped off between Johnston and Granger.  Much of the damage along the most severe track was in the F1 intensity category, with speeds in the 75 to 110 MPH range.  A few spots along the path, such as in the Granger and Camp Dodge area, sustained sufficient damage to justify F2 winds, 110 to 155 MPH.  It appears a tornado or family of tornadoes touched down southeast of Berkley and moved southeast into the Pleasant Hill area just east of Des Moines.  The track was intermittent, indicating either one tornado touching down occasionally, or one or more weak tornadoes rotating around the meso circulation.  The worst effected metro areas were the Granger area, Johnston, and the northeast side of Des Moines proper.  A duplex in Granger was flattened by the winds.  There were several reports of roofs being ripped off of stores and houses in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Several small private planes were flipped at a small air field north of Des Moines.  There were also several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being blown over on Interstate 35.  Heavy construction equipment was overturned on Interstate 35/80 just north of Des Moines.  Damage was extensive to the east side of Des Moines proper.  To make matters worse, following the passage of the main line of thunderstorms, a second line of severe thunderstorms developed and moved across the same areas already hit.  The storms were smaller, but did produce brief tornado touch downs and hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter.  The second line of storms did eventually combine with the first and moved southeast across the rest of the state.  Damage was widespread across the state and it will be months before final numbers are in.  Estimates from Polk County alone are near $100 million in damage including cleanup.  Totals were still being tallied at this writing, however a few include over $11 million in damage from initial claims in Johnston and $726,000 from West Des Moines just to city buildings and systems.  West Des Moines was on the far west edge of the major damage however.  In addition to the property damage, at least 125 people were injured during the storm.  Most of the injuries were caused by flying debris and many were not serious.  Fortunately there were no fatalities.  Heavy damage was reported by MidAmerica Energy.  On a state wide report, they indicated 200,000 homes  were without electricity, effecting over 500,000 people, at one time during the storm.  In the metropolitan Des Moines area, 100,000 homes were without electricity at the height of the storm.  That number was reduced to around 25,000 36 hours later.  The worst damaged areas were without power for 5 to 6 days.  Heavy damage was also reported by local telephone and cable systems.  In Polk County, the worst damage extended from the Camp Dodge area into the northeast parts of Des Moines.  At least 462 homes in the metro Des Moines area sustained significant damage.  Statewide, 80 homes were destroyed, 559 sustained severe damage, with 1416 others receiving moderate damage.  In the Camp Dodge area, 80 to 90 percent of the brick buildings were damaged with the roofs removed from many of them.  Lightning from the storms struck the WSR-88D in the midst of the storm.  The radar was taken out of service for more than 24 hours because of this.  In addition to the severe weather, flooding quickly became a problem.  Iowa soil was nearly saturated as the weather pattern had been very wet for six weeks previous.  Although rainfall was not extreme, one to three inches of rain fell over a several county area.  This caused widespread urban flooding across north central into central Iowa, though damage from the flooding was not serious.  Crop damage was very difficult to determine and will not likely be clear until the fall harvest.  Reports from some of the local extension agents say damage to the corn ranged up to 75% destroyed in areas with the highest wind, such as the swath that went through central Iowa in association with the tornado there.  No doubt losses will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not in the millions.   Accounts of damage were of course too numerous to document here as the areal extent of the storms was very large.  Countless reports of parts of crop fields being flattened were received.  Semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned by the high winds both in the Des Moines metro area as well as in Newton.  Trees were found on houses over a large part of the state.  One news reported wrote ""there is not a power pole standing between Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa"".  Though not figuratively true, this statement does point out the extensive damage that occurred with these storms.l",,PDC

The primary focusing mechanisms were a strong mid level shortwave and surface cold front that approached the region during the evening of the 2nd.  Strongly veering wind profiles that increased with height contributed significantly to the development of tornadic supercells.     Two long tracked supercells produced tornadic damage across northeastern Pennsylvania during this event.  The first tornado touched down in southwestern Susquehanna county in Auburn towship just after 9 pm EDT.  This tornado tracked along a 12 mile path through Springville and Lathrop townships.  Several mobile homes were damaged or destroyed and the roof of a small storage building was torn away.  The twister also cut down scores of trees along the way.  Its intensity was rated as F1.  Fortunately, no injuries resulted.     The other twister tracked along approximately a 35 mile path from extreme southeastern Bradford county across the length of northern Wyoming county and into northwestern Lackawanna county before weakening.  The most devastation occurred in the small vacation community of Lake Carey in Wyoming county.  The tornado strengthened to F3 intensity at Lake Carey and killed two people and injured a total of fifteen.  More than 40 homes immediately surrounding the lake were either heavily damaged or destroyed.  Additional residences were damaged or leveled further to the east through East Lemon township in northern Wyoming county.  Isolated structural damage and considerable tree damage was the rule from Terry township in Bradford county eastward to just west of Lake Carey and also from East Lemon township eastward to near Lackawanna State Park where the tornado finally dissipated.  In all, over 50 homes were damaged or destroyed and total damage estimates in the three county area exceeded three million dollars.     Other smaller scale bow echo complexes produced widespread wind damage in the form of downed trees and power lines primarily across the northern tier counties and sections of the Poconos.  Portions of Bradford, Susquehanna, and Wayne counties were without power for most of the night as electrical crews could not keep up with reports of downed wires.       The most severely damaged areas including the Lake Carey vicinity needed assistance from the National Gaurd to clean up excess debris and help with repairs.  Much of northeastern Pennsylvania qualified for federal disaster assistance.","The same tornadic cell that devastated parts of Wyoming county moved eastward and crossed into northern Lackawanna county.  It remained tornadic as it affected La Plume township around 1040 pm EDT.  Significant tree damage occurred on the campus of Keystone Junior College as a couple of classroom buildings also sustained minor damage in the form of blown out windows and twisted gutters.     The tornado pushed eastward from that point and crossed over Routes 6 and 11 before settling into southern portions of Lackawanna State Park in North Abington township.  Large swaths of trees were either sheared off or cut down in sections of the park.       The twister appeared to lift back into the cloud base just west of Abington Road in North Abington township as little in the way of damage was seen downstream of this location.     The tornado's intensity was rated as F1 with a damage width of around 200 yards.  Very fortunately, no injuries were sustained either on the college campus or within Lackawanna State Park.",PDC

Initially, the surface warm front was located to the south of this system.  That was not actually the case aloft however.  During the predawn hours the surface front surged north and by sunrise was located across northeast Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable to the south of the front with dew point temperatures will in the 70s F.  The initial development of thunderstorms took place during the early part of the day over northeast Nebraska.  The storms became severe quickly as they moved and developed eastward into Iowa.  By mid morning, the storms had formed a nearly east to west line.  Storm relative inflow into the line was around 40 knots.  The storms produced a variety of severe weather across Iowa.  They initially moved east across the northern and central counties, but then began sinking sinking southeast.  The dominant severe weather with the storms was extremely high winds.  Damage was very widespread across the state.  Winds in excess of 100 MPH were reported with one unofficial wind speed measured at 126 MPH in the town of Washington at 1405 CST.  In one unusual story, high winds hit Mahaska County.  Three miles south of New Sharon, a puppy was tied to its dog house which was picked up by the wind.  The dog house and puppy were lifted over the top of a two car garage and a corn crib.  Both were deposited in the farm yard.  When found the dog house was upside down and the puppy, though scared, was fine.  There were several tornadoes during the event.  One of the longer track well defined tornadoes was the initial tornado.  It was on the ground for about 11 miles as it swept across Crawford County.  Several residences, outbuildings, grain bins, and trees were damaged along its path.  Reports indicate that between 30 and 50 residences were damaged by this tornado.  There were several small tornadoes in central Iowa.  They had short tracks and only touched down briefly.  One cut a mile long path east of Marshalltown through a corn field and a grove of trees.  Another in Dallas County was on the ground through mostly open country for two miles.  High winds were a major problem with these storms.  Many places reported winds over 80 MPH with incredible tree damage and numerous buildings damaged or destroyed.  At least 38 counties were declared disaster areas by the Federal Government due to the severe damage and flooding.  A final total will not be available before publication deadlines, however preliminary data have been included.  In the Des Moines County Warning Area these included:  Wright, Franklin, Butler, Bremer, Hamilton, Hardin, Grundy, Crawford, Carroll, Greene, Boone, Story, Marshall,  Audubon, Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Jasper, Cass, Adair, Madison, Warren, Marion, Adams, and Taylor.  One of the hardest hit Counties was Polk County.  Damage appeared to be from straight line winds based on a storm survey that was done following the event.  The damage occurred over the southwest semicircle of a large meso low in contact with the ground.  Due to the rapid translational speed of 50 to 75 MPH, winds were enhanced on the southwest semicircle of the meso low.  Smaller scale winds could have been embedded within this circulation as well.  There was little evidence of small scale convergent tornadic damage, however aerial surveys did make some suggestion and eye witness accounts of sightings were quite numerous in the metro Des Moines area.  All trees and debris were laid down to the south or southeast.  The major damage swath as 3 to 7 miles wide northwest of Camp Dodge, with a widening into a full blown derecho after that.  The event was born a few miles northwest of Perry, between Rippey and Berkley in southwest Boone County.  The mile wide damage path expanded to over 3 miles by the time it reached full intensity near highway 169 between Woodward and Perry.  The path continued through Granger, Camp Dodge, and Johnston.  The path was nearly 7 miles wide near Granger.  A second, smaller, meso low passed near Madrid, downing power lines.  This meso low matured near Jester Park Golf Course, causing significant structural damage to houses.  The two meso lows merged near the NWS Forecast Office in Johnston, with two miles of power poles snapped off between Johnston and Granger.  Much of the damage along the most severe track was in the F1 intensity category, with speeds in the 75 to 110 MPH range.  A few spots along the path, such as in the Granger and Camp Dodge area, sustained sufficient damage to justify F2 winds, 110 to 155 MPH.  It appears a tornado or family of tornadoes touched down southeast of Berkley and moved southeast into the Pleasant Hill area just east of Des Moines.  The track was intermittent, indicating either one tornado touching down occasionally, or one or more weak tornadoes rotating around the meso circulation.  The worst effected metro areas were the Granger area, Johnston, and the northeast side of Des Moines proper.  A duplex in Granger was flattened by the winds.  There were several reports of roofs being ripped off of stores and houses in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Several small private planes were flipped at a small air field north of Des Moines.  There were also several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being blown over on Interstate 35.  Heavy construction equipment was overturned on Interstate 35/80 just north of Des Moines.  Damage was extensive to the east side of Des Moines proper.  To make matters worse, following the passage of the main line of thunderstorms, a second line of severe thunderstorms developed and moved across the same areas already hit.  The storms were smaller, but did produce brief tornado touch downs and hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter.  The second line of storms did eventually combine with the first and moved southeast across the rest of the state.  Damage was widespread across the state and it will be months before final numbers are in.  Estimates from Polk County alone are near $100 million in damage including cleanup.  Totals were still being tallied at this writing, however a few include over $11 million in damage from initial claims in Johnston and $726,000 from West Des Moines just to city buildings and systems.  West Des Moines was on the far west edge of the major damage however.  In addition to the property damage, at least 125 people were injured during the storm.  Most of the injuries were caused by flying debris and many were not serious.  Fortunately there were no fatalities.  Heavy damage was reported by MidAmerica Energy.  On a state wide report, they indicated 200,000 homes  were without electricity, effecting over 500,000 people, at one time during the storm.  In the metropolitan Des Moines area, 100,000 homes were without electricity at the height of the storm.  That number was reduced to around 25,000 36 hours later.  The worst damaged areas were without power for 5 to 6 days.  Heavy damage was also reported by local telephone and cable systems.  In Polk County, the worst damage extended from the Camp Dodge area into the northeast parts of Des Moines.  At least 462 homes in the metro Des Moines area sustained significant damage.  Statewide, 80 homes were destroyed, 559 sustained severe damage, with 1416 others receiving moderate damage.  In the Camp Dodge area, 80 to 90 percent of the brick buildings were damaged with the roofs removed from many of them.  Lightning from the storms struck the WSR-88D in the midst of the storm.  The radar was taken out of service for more than 24 hours because of this.  In addition to the severe weather, flooding quickly became a problem.  Iowa soil was nearly saturated as the weather pattern had been very wet for six weeks previous.  Although rainfall was not extreme, one to three inches of rain fell over a several county area.  This caused widespread urban flooding across north central into central Iowa, though damage from the flooding was not serious.  Crop damage was very difficult to determine and will not likely be clear until the fall harvest.  Reports from some of the local extension agents say damage to the corn ranged up to 75% destroyed in areas with the highest wind, such as the swath that went through central Iowa in association with the tornado there.  No doubt losses will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not in the millions.   Accounts of damage were of course too numerous to document here as the areal extent of the storms was very large.  Countless reports of parts of crop fields being flattened were received.  Semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned by the high winds both in the Des Moines metro area as well as in Newton.  Trees were found on houses over a large part of the state.  One news reported wrote ""there is not a power pole standing between Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa"".  Though not figuratively true, this statement does point out the extensive damage that occurred with these storms.l",,PDC

This was the final in a series of heavy storms which pummelled the region this month.  In many areas the ground was nearly saturated and some reservoirs were nearing or exceeding their capacity.  The two, to locally five inches of rain which ensued, caused widespread flooding and property damage, prompting the President to declare all four counties Federal Disaster Areas.  Strong winds gusting over 40 mph at times felled trees, whose support was weakened in the water-logged soils, which snapped utility lines, resulting in sporadic power outages.  Snow levels dropped as low as 1400 feet in the high deserts of San Bernardino County and wind gusts to 60 mph knocked out power to thousands.  In the mountains, 1 to 2 feet of heavy, wet snow above 6000 feet, snapped tree branches and power lines.   Above 7000 feet, 3 to 4 feet of snow fell.  In Laguna Beach, two hillsides gave way, sending a river of mud and water through homes and cars.  Two men were killed and at least two others injured, and three hundred homes were damaged, 18 of them seriously.  In Apple Valley and Hesperia, flooding caused major damage to scores of homes, while hundreds of homes and businesses in other communities suffered minor damage.  In Apple Valley alone, two dozen families were evacuated, and damage to public and private property reached $10 million.  Parts of 74 roads had to be closed throughout the Victor Valley.  Many roads, rail lines, and bridges were damaged or had to be closed for a time, including I-15 through the Cajon Pass.  Dangerous swift-water rescues occurred in Colton, Pedley, Canyon Lake, Redlands, Sun City and San Jacinto.  In San Diego County, 200 people were evacuated from three mobile home parks in Oceanside, and portions of Camp Pendleton were flooded, due to the raging Loma Alta Creek.  Numerous sink holes developed.  One near the I-15 and Balboa Avenue in San Diego, measured 550 feet long, 35 feet wide, and 65 feet deep.  The San Diego River at Fashion Valley peaked at 15.1 feet at 4:00 am on the twenty-fourth, which is 3.8 feet above flood stage.  For the third time this month, low lying roads, golf courses, and parking facilities were inundated.  The persistent wet weather damaged the strawberry crop, assorted winter vegetables, citrus and avocado groves, and hurt the flower industry in San Diego County, but losses to dairymen in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties was staggering.  Thousands of cows succumbed to the weather.  Some drowned, others died of exhaustion and fatigue from struggling through 3 to 4 feet of mud, and many lost calves.  Damage estimates to residences, businesses, property, infrastructure, agriculture, and the cost of emergency services, and for clean-up for all four counties exceeded $100 million.  While a large percentage of this figure is attributable to this storm, some portion was the result of previous storms this month.  The environment that these storms created, helped facilitate the runoff and subsequent flooding which ensued during this final storm of the month.   Toward the end of the storm, a small tornado touched down in Huntington Beach at the Villa Huntington Mobile Estates.  A carport and children's playroom was ripped up.  Flying debris hit a transformer, knocking out power to 200 homes and a portion of a roof settled atop a tree one quarter mile away.

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's ""gust front"" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently ""microbursts"" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.  Overall, approximately twelve people sustained injuries and damage was estimated around $16 million.","A tornado touched down on the west side of Farmington and travelled to the east southeast.  It first severely damaged a lumberyard, ripping off the roof of a large storage facility.  Then as it moved into the downtown area, several buildings sustained damage to the back walls, as well as, roof damage.  Also, several projectiles were found in this area (2x4s driven into the ground).  A block down the road a house lost its roof and then as the tornado moved into the east side of town, the second story of a brick building was demolished.  Across the street at the high school, a large garage was destroyed which damaged several vehicles.  Also, the gymnasium sustained significant roof and water damage and the new press box and bleachers at the football stadium were destroyed.  Damage at the high school was estimated around $400,000.

The largest concentration of tree damage was from the South Hills and Kanawha City sections of Charleston on east,  to Malden.   So the wind damage was still substantial.  One large tree damaged a church, another tree heavily damaged a home along Lower Donnally Road.   The largest insurance company reported a total of about 10,000 claims  for homes and vehicles combined.One Kanawha City business owner said, ""I never saw anything like this before.  I never thought I'd go through this in West Virginia.""   The junior high school in Kanawha City was to be letting students go home just before the storm hit.  Instead, the staff and students took shelter in the interior hallways of the school.    The warnings and the smart action by citizens of the Kanawha Valley prevented any injuries from this powerful thunderstorm.","The tornado moved up Chappell Hollow, in the Kanawha City section of Charleston.  The path was along the east facing slope of the hollow, and narrowly missed several homes.  A few homes were still damaged by fallen trees.  The estimated winds were between 90 and 100 mph.",PDC

The primary focusing mechanisms were a strong mid level shortwave and surface cold front that approached the region during the evening of the 2nd.  Strongly veering wind profiles that increased with height contributed significantly to the development of tornadic supercells.     Two long tracked supercells produced tornadic damage across northeastern Pennsylvania during this event.  The first tornado touched down in southwestern Susquehanna county in Auburn towship just after 9 pm EDT.  This tornado tracked along a 12 mile path through Springville and Lathrop townships.  Several mobile homes were damaged or destroyed and the roof of a small storage building was torn away.  The twister also cut down scores of trees along the way.  Its intensity was rated as F1.  Fortunately, no injuries resulted.     The other twister tracked along approximately a 35 mile path from extreme southeastern Bradford county across the length of northern Wyoming county and into northwestern Lackawanna county before weakening.  The most devastation occurred in the small vacation community of Lake Carey in Wyoming county.  The tornado strengthened to F3 intensity at Lake Carey and killed two people and injured a total of fifteen.  More than 40 homes immediately surrounding the lake were either heavily damaged or destroyed.  Additional residences were damaged or leveled further to the east through East Lemon township in northern Wyoming county.  Isolated structural damage and considerable tree damage was the rule from Terry township in Bradford county eastward to just west of Lake Carey and also from East Lemon township eastward to near Lackawanna State Park where the tornado finally dissipated.  In all, over 50 homes were damaged or destroyed and total damage estimates in the three county area exceeded three million dollars.     Other smaller scale bow echo complexes produced widespread wind damage in the form of downed trees and power lines primarily across the northern tier counties and sections of the Poconos.  Portions of Bradford, Susquehanna, and Wayne counties were without power for most of the night as electrical crews could not keep up with reports of downed wires.       The most severely damaged areas including the Lake Carey vicinity needed assistance from the National Gaurd to clean up excess debris and help with repairs.  Much of northeastern Pennsylvania qualified for federal disaster assistance.","The same tornadic supercell that affected southeastern Bradford county moved eastward into northern Wyoming county around 10 pm EDT.  Aerial damage surveys indicate that intervals of tree damage occurred from Meshoppen eastward to near Valentine Hill on the border of Lemon township.  This damage was primarily in the form of twisted off tree sections at canopy level and also some uprooted trees on hilltop areas.       Between 1010 and 1015 pm, the tornado lowered again down the east side of Valentine Hill, skipped across the far north end of Stevens Lake, and carved a path over a small hill just west of Lake Carey.  Several residences along this path had heavy tree damage and minor siding and roof damage to their homes.  The twister then seemed to temporarily turn towards the south and cross a portion of the long axis of Lake Carey.  It was here within this small vacation community that the most severe damage occurred along with loss of life.  Eyewitness accounts indicate that the tornado crossed State Route 1003 (a small causeway across the short axis of the lake in an west-east orientation) at about 1020 pm.  Every structure located along this narrow strip of land crossing Lake Carey either sustained substantial damage or was completely leveled.  It was here where two fatalities occurred as an elderly woman and her grandson were literally sucked out of the second floor of a house and thrown into an adjacent building.  Every nearby tree was snapped off, uprooted, or otherwise toppled in chaotic patterns.  At that point, the tornado made a jog to the left and resumed its eastward course.  It crossed over State Route 1005, which parallels the eastern end of Lake Carey, then skipped up over a small hill.  Again, heavy damage was inflicted upon homes in the path of the tornado both along the east end of the lake and also going up the hill.  A dozen or more small boats which were anchored along the eastern end of the lake were thrown up out of the water and onto the shoreline.  One home going up the hill towards the east was reduced to only its foundation and a portion of the back wall.  Massive tree damage continued to be evident with a swath of trees cut down in a narrow path going over the hill and down its eastern side towards East Lemon township.  A total of 42 homes in and around Lake Carey suffered considerable damage or were totally destroyed.  The character of damage in this area indicates that the tornado strengthened and reached F3 intensity.  The damage path was over a third of a mile wide at times.       As the tornado pushed further to the east through East Lemon township, it encountered more rugged terrain and less populated areas.  Still, however, it did encounter three additional homes and heavily damaged all of them.  One had its roof completely torn away and its garage flattened.  Another had its back deck destroyed and all of the back windows blown out.  Swaths of tree damage were interspersed amongst these houses.  Fortunately, two of the homes were unoccupied at the time with only one other minor injury associated with the storm in East Lemon township.  The tornado was rated as F2 intensity at this point with damage widths varying from 250 to 400 yards.       As the cell approached Factoryville and the Lackawanna county line after 1035 pm EDT, it weakened a bit with the tornado skipping over hilltop sections for the most part.  Mostly tree damage was evident from aerial surveys between Route 92 and Lake Sheridan.  The tornado's intensity had decreased to F1 along this segment of its path with the width of damage narrowing to under 100 yards in spots.     In total, county emergency management officials estimated that in excess of 2 million dollars worth of damage was incurred with over 50 homes destroyed or heavily damaged.  Fifteen injuries were directly tied to the tornado along with the two deaths mentioned earlier.",PDC

The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's ""gust front"" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently ""microbursts"" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.

Initially, the surface warm front was located to the south of this system.  That was not actually the case aloft however.  During the predawn hours the surface front surged north and by sunrise was located across northeast Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable to the south of the front with dew point temperatures will in the 70s F.  The initial development of thunderstorms took place during the early part of the day over northeast Nebraska.  The storms became severe quickly as they moved and developed eastward into Iowa.  By mid morning, the storms had formed a nearly east to west line.  Storm relative inflow into the line was around 40 knots.  The storms produced a variety of severe weather across Iowa.  They initially moved east across the northern and central counties, but then began sinking sinking southeast.  The dominant severe weather with the storms was extremely high winds.  Damage was very widespread across the state.  Winds in excess of 100 MPH were reported with one unofficial wind speed measured at 126 MPH in the town of Washington at 1405 CST.  In one unusual story, high winds hit Mahaska County.  Three miles south of New Sharon, a puppy was tied to its dog house which was picked up by the wind.  The dog house and puppy were lifted over the top of a two car garage and a corn crib.  Both were deposited in the farm yard.  When found the dog house was upside down and the puppy, though scared, was fine.  There were several tornadoes during the event.  One of the longer track well defined tornadoes was the initial tornado.  It was on the ground for about 11 miles as it swept across Crawford County.  Several residences, outbuildings, grain bins, and trees were damaged along its path.  Reports indicate that between 30 and 50 residences were damaged by this tornado.  There were several small tornadoes in central Iowa.  They had short tracks and only touched down briefly.  One cut a mile long path east of Marshalltown through a corn field and a grove of trees.  Another in Dallas County was on the ground through mostly open country for two miles.  High winds were a major problem with these storms.  Many places reported winds over 80 MPH with incredible tree damage and numerous buildings damaged or destroyed.  At least 38 counties were declared disaster areas by the Federal Government due to the severe damage and flooding.  A final total will not be available before publication deadlines, however preliminary data have been included.  In the Des Moines County Warning Area these included:  Wright, Franklin, Butler, Bremer, Hamilton, Hardin, Grundy, Crawford, Carroll, Greene, Boone, Story, Marshall,  Audubon, Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Jasper, Cass, Adair, Madison, Warren, Marion, Adams, and Taylor.  One of the hardest hit Counties was Polk County.  Damage appeared to be from straight line winds based on a storm survey that was done following the event.  The damage occurred over the southwest semicircle of a large meso low in contact with the ground.  Due to the rapid translational speed of 50 to 75 MPH, winds were enhanced on the southwest semicircle of the meso low.  Smaller scale winds could have been embedded within this circulation as well.  There was little evidence of small scale convergent tornadic damage, however aerial surveys did make some suggestion and eye witness accounts of sightings were quite numerous in the metro Des Moines area.  All trees and debris were laid down to the south or southeast.  The major damage swath as 3 to 7 miles wide northwest of Camp Dodge, with a widening into a full blown derecho after that.  The event was born a few miles northwest of Perry, between Rippey and Berkley in southwest Boone County.  The mile wide damage path expanded to over 3 miles by the time it reached full intensity near highway 169 between Woodward and Perry.  The path continued through Granger, Camp Dodge, and Johnston.  The path was nearly 7 miles wide near Granger.  A second, smaller, meso low passed near Madrid, downing power lines.  This meso low matured near Jester Park Golf Course, causing significant structural damage to houses.  The two meso lows merged near the NWS Forecast Office in Johnston, with two miles of power poles snapped off between Johnston and Granger.  Much of the damage along the most severe track was in the F1 intensity category, with speeds in the 75 to 110 MPH range.  A few spots along the path, such as in the Granger and Camp Dodge area, sustained sufficient damage to justify F2 winds, 110 to 155 MPH.  It appears a tornado or family of tornadoes touched down southeast of Berkley and moved southeast into the Pleasant Hill area just east of Des Moines.  The track was intermittent, indicating either one tornado touching down occasionally, or one or more weak tornadoes rotating around the meso circulation.  The worst effected metro areas were the Granger area, Johnston, and the northeast side of Des Moines proper.  A duplex in Granger was flattened by the winds.  There were several reports of roofs being ripped off of stores and houses in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Several small private planes were flipped at a small air field north of Des Moines.  There were also several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being blown over on Interstate 35.  Heavy construction equipment was overturned on Interstate 35/80 just north of Des Moines.  Damage was extensive to the east side of Des Moines proper.  To make matters worse, following the passage of the main line of thunderstorms, a second line of severe thunderstorms developed and moved across the same areas already hit.  The storms were smaller, but did produce brief tornado touch downs and hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter.  The second line of storms did eventually combine with the first and moved southeast across the rest of the state.  Damage was widespread across the state and it will be months before final numbers are in.  Estimates from Polk County alone are near $100 million in damage including cleanup.  Totals were still being tallied at this writing, however a few include over $11 million in damage from initial claims in Johnston and $726,000 from West Des Moines just to city buildings and systems.  West Des Moines was on the far west edge of the major damage however.  In addition to the property damage, at least 125 people were injured during the storm.  Most of the injuries were caused by flying debris and many were not serious.  Fortunately there were no fatalities.  Heavy damage was reported by MidAmerica Energy.  On a state wide report, they indicated 200,000 homes  were without electricity, effecting over 500,000 people, at one time during the storm.  In the metropolitan Des Moines area, 100,000 homes were without electricity at the height of the storm.  That number was reduced to around 25,000 36 hours later.  The worst damaged areas were without power for 5 to 6 days.  Heavy damage was also reported by local telephone and cable systems.  In Polk County, the worst damage extended from the Camp Dodge area into the northeast parts of Des Moines.  At least 462 homes in the metro Des Moines area sustained significant damage.  Statewide, 80 homes were destroyed, 559 sustained severe damage, with 1416 others receiving moderate damage.  In the Camp Dodge area, 80 to 90 percent of the brick buildings were damaged with the roofs removed from many of them.  Lightning from the storms struck the WSR-88D in the midst of the storm.  The radar was taken out of service for more than 24 hours because of this.  In addition to the severe weather, flooding quickly became a problem.  Iowa soil was nearly saturated as the weather pattern had been very wet for six weeks previous.  Although rainfall was not extreme, one to three inches of rain fell over a several county area.  This caused widespread urban flooding across north central into central Iowa, though damage from the flooding was not serious.  Crop damage was very difficult to determine and will not likely be clear until the fall harvest.  Reports from some of the local extension agents say damage to the corn ranged up to 75% destroyed in areas with the highest wind, such as the swath that went through central Iowa in association with the tornado there.  No doubt losses will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not in the millions.   Accounts of damage were of course too numerous to document here as the areal extent of the storms was very large.  Countless reports of parts of crop fields being flattened were received.  Semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned by the high winds both in the Des Moines metro area as well as in Newton.  Trees were found on houses over a large part of the state.  One news reported wrote ""there is not a power pole standing between Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa"".  Though not figuratively true, this statement does point out the extensive damage that occurred with these storms.l",,PDC

One of the longer track well defined tornadoes was the initial tornado.  It was on the ground for about 11 miles as it swept across Crawford County.  Several residences, outbuildings, grain bins, and trees were damaged along its path.  Reports indicate that between 30 and 50 residences were damaged by this tornado.  There were several small tornadoes in central Iowa.  They had short tracks and only touched down briefly.  One cut a mile long path east of Marshalltown through a corn field and a grove of trees.  Another in Dallas County was on the ground through mostly open country for two miles.  High winds were a major problem with these storms.  Many places reported winds over 80 MPH with incredible tree damage and numerous buildings damaged or destroyed.  At least 38 counties were declared disaster areas by the Federal Government due to the severe damage and flooding.  A final total will not be available before publication deadlines, however preliminary data have been included.  In the Des Moines County Warning Area these included:  Wright, Franklin, Butler, Bremer, Hamilton, Hardin, Grundy, Crawford, Carroll, Greene, Boone, Story, Marshall,  Audubon, Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Jasper, Cass, Adair, Madison, Warren, Marion, Adams, and Taylor.  One of the hardest hit Counties was Polk County.  Damage appeared to be from straight line winds based on a storm survey that was done following the event.  The damage occurred over the southwest semicircle of a large meso low in contact with the ground.  Due to the rapid translational speed of 50 to 75 MPH, winds were enhanced on the southwest semicircle of the meso low.  Smaller scale winds could have been embedded within this circulation as well.  There was little evidence of small scale convergent tornadic damage, however aerial surveys did make some suggestion and eye witness accounts of sightings were quite numerous in the metro Des Moines area.  All trees and debris were laid down to the south or southeast.  The major damage swath as 3 to 7 miles wide northwest of Camp Dodge, with a widening into a full blown derecho after that.  The event was born a few miles northwest of Perry, between Rippey and Berkley in southwest Boone County.  The mile wide damage path expanded to over 3 miles by the time it reached full intensity near highway 169 between Woodward and Perry.  The path continued through Granger, Camp Dodge, and Johnston.  The path was nearly 7 miles wide near Granger.  A second, smaller, meso low passed near Madrid, downing power lines.  This meso low matured near Jester Park Golf Course, causing significant structural damage to houses.  The two meso lows merged near the NWS Forecast Office in Johnston, with two miles of power poles snapped off between Johnston and Granger.  Much of the damage along the most severe track was in the F1 intensity category, with speeds in the 75 to 110 MPH range.  A few spots along the path, such as in the Granger and Camp Dodge area, sustained sufficient damage to justify F2 winds, 110 to 155 MPH.  It appears a tornado or family of tornadoes touched down southeast of Berkley and moved southeast into the Pleasant Hill area just east of Des Moines.  The track was intermittent, indicating either one tornado touching down occasionally, or one or more weak tornadoes rotating around the meso circulation.  The worst effected metro areas were the Granger area, Johnston, and the northeast side of Des Moines proper.  A duplex in Granger was flattened by the winds.  There were several reports of roofs being ripped off of stores and houses in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Several small private planes were flipped at a small air field north of Des Moines.  There were also several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being blown over on Interstate 35.  Heavy construction equipment was overturned on Interstate 35/80 just north of Des Moines.  Damage was extensive to the east side of Des Moines proper.  To make matters worse, following the passage of the main line of thunderstorms, a second line of severe thunderstorms developed and moved across the same areas already hit.  The storms were smaller, but did produce brief tornado touch downs and hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter.  The second line of storms did eventually combine with the first and moved southeast across the rest of the state.  Damage was widespread across the state and it will be months before final numbers are in.  Estimates from Polk County alone are near $100 million in damage including cleanup.  Totals were still being tallied at this writing, however a few include over $11 million in damage from initial claims in Johnston and $726,000 from West Des Moines just to city buildings and systems.  West Des Moines was on the far west edge of the major damage however.  In addition to the property damage, at least 125 people were injured during the storm.  Most of the injuries were caused by flying debris and many were not serious.  Fortunately there were no fatalities.  Heavy damage was reported by MidAmerica Energy.  On a state wide report, they indicated 200,000 homes  were without electricity, effecting over 500,000 people, at one time during the storm.  In the metropolitan Des Moines area, 100,000 homes were without electricity at the height of the storm.  That number was reduced to around 25,000 36 hours later.  The worst damaged areas were without power for 5 to 6 days.  Heavy damage was also reported by local telephone and cable systems.  In Polk County, the worst damage extended from the Camp Dodge area into the northeast parts of Des Moines.  At least 462 homes in the metro Des Moines area sustained significant damage.  Statewide, 80 homes were destroyed, 559 sustained severe damage, with 1416 others receiving moderate damage.  In the Camp Dodge area, 80 to 90 percent of the brick buildings were damaged with the roofs removed from many of them.  Lightning from the storms struck the WSR-88D in the midst of the storm.  The radar was taken out of service for more than 24 hours because of this.  In addition to the severe weather, flooding quickly became a problem.  Iowa soil was nearly saturated as the weather pattern had been very wet for six weeks previous.  Although rainfall was not extreme, one to three inches of rain fell over a several county area.  This caused widespread urban flooding across north central into central Iowa, though damage from the flooding was not serious.  Crop damage was very difficult to determine and will not likely be clear until the fall harvest.  Reports from some of the local extension agents say damage to the corn ranged up to 75% destroyed in areas with the highest wind, such as the swath that went through central Iowa in association with the tornado there.  No doubt losses will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not in the millions.   Accounts of damage were of course too numerous to document here as the areal extent of the storms was very large.  Countless reports of parts of crop fields being flattened were received.  Semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned by the high winds both in the Des Moines metro area as well as in Newton.  Trees were found on houses over a large part of the state.  One news reported wrote ""there is not a power pole standing between Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa"".  Though not figuratively true, this statement does point out the extensive damage that occurred with these storms.l",,PDC

However, the majority of damage was caused by 60 to greater than 100 mph straightline winds.   The strong winds flattened farm fields, damaged roofs, and blew over semitrailers.  Numerous trees and power lines downed by the storm resulted in power and telephone outages lasting from a few hours, to several days at the most seriously damaged locations.   In Hancock and Henderson counties 30 electrical poles were broken. Illinois utility companies reported that more than  58,000 homes and businesses were affected by outages.

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County.

Warm humid air quickly invaded the area on the morning of October 4 and then collided with a cold front moving southward by evening.  The threat from these storms ran the full range of possibilities from destructive tornadoes to damaging winds to very large hail up to the size of baseballs.Numerous storms occurred on the evening of October 4, mainly north of Interstate 40.  The two most significant storms both moved eastward out of central Oklahoma.  One produced an F1 tornado that passed through Pawnee.  The other produced a 27-mile track F2 tornado that started in Okfuskee County and ended in Okmulgee County.  This second storm later went on to produce considerable hail and wind damage in the city of Okmulgee.  Many other thunderstorms developed during the evening in central Oklahoma, fanned by upper level winds in excess of 100 knots.

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.",,PDC

The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.",,PDC

At least 22 tornadoes occurred throughout Oklahoma, of which seven were in northeast Oklahoma.  This outbreak of severe weather resulted as a powerful upper level storm system moved across the central plains and surface low pressure developed over southwest Oklahoma.  Warm humid air quickly invaded the area on the morning of October 4 and then collided with a cold front moving southward by evening.  The threat from these storms ran the full range of possibilities from destructive tornadoes to damaging winds to very large hail up to the size of baseballs.Numerous storms occurred on the evening of October 4, mainly north of Interstate 40.  The two most significant storms both moved eastward out of central Oklahoma.  One produced an F1 tornado that passed through Pawnee.  The other produced a 27-mile track F2 tornado that started in Okfuskee County and ended in Okmulgee County.  This second storm later went on to produce considerable hail and wind damage in the city of Okmulgee.  Many other thunderstorms developed during the evening in central Oklahoma, fanned by upper level winds in excess of 100 knots.  These storms moved into northeast Oklahoma, causing additional severe weather late in the evening that gradually spread eastward to the Arkansas state line.  After midnight, the storms congealed and became a slow-moving line of thunderstorms that sat over nearly the same area of northeast Oklahoma through the overnight hours.  The severe threat gradually diminished through the night, and flooding became the main problem.  For more information on the flooding, see the separate event entry for the flooding.  By late on the afternoon of October 5, the slow-moving line had moved into southeast Oklahoma and flared up during the heat of the afternoon, causing a few additional severe weather reports in the form of strong winds.","A tornado briefly touched down in the southwest part of the city of Pawnee at 738 PM CDT near 6th Street and Ash.  The tornado travelled northeast for 0.4 miles and had a width of 125 yards.  Many trees were downed or snapped along the path with about fifty homes receiving minor roof, window, and porch damage.  One mobile home was destroyed.  Widespread wind damage also occurred in Pawnee due to strong winds in the vicinity of the tornado known as a ""rear flank downdraft"".  The roof at the high school auditorium was blown off by the nearby winds.  Damage from the tornado and the winds combined were nearly $2 million.  (The official damage estimate in this entry does not include damages caused by the nearby winds.)Most of the tornado damage was F0.  However, the tornado was rated F1 based on an estimate of the most intense winds reaching speeds near 85 mph.  The tornado lifted before reaching US Hwy 64.  However, an isolated home downstream of the tornado path and 2 miles from downtown Pawnee received F1 damage.  The Pawnee mesonet site, located 3 miles ENE of Pawnee and 0.4 miles north of the house, measured wind gusts as high as 80 mph. (See the separate Thunderstorm Wind entry for more information on the mesonet observations.)  The open prairie, the associated lack of tracers (wind-blown objects) near the mesonet site, and the isolated nature of the home make it impossible to determine if tornadic damage occurred at/near these locations.  However, the tornado damage in Pawnee, the F1 damaged home, and the mesonet site are all aligned along the storm's motion.",PDC

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.",,PDC

Casualties in south Florida included two drownings in a fishing boat that capsized near the Dry Tortugas and about 65 injuries, most of them minor, in the upper keys involving hurricane spawned tornadoes.  Losses are estimated at $50 million, including $20 million in crop damage. Much of the property damage was caused by five tornadoes, one of which reached a maximum intensity of F2, in the upper Keys.  A total of 646 dwellings were damaged in an area from Islamorada to north Key Largo.  Other tornadoes were observed in Broward, Palm Beach, and Collier counties. Widespread rainfall totals across south Florida averaged 6 to 8 inches with local amounts of 13 inches. The storm surge of 2 to 4 feet along the Keys and southwest Florida coast, and 1 to 2 feet along the southeast coast, produced minor flooding, beach erosion and damage to marine structures and vessels.

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.",,PDC

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted.

Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.",,PDC

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes.

Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.",,PDC

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage.

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.",,PDC

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.",,PDC

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.",,PDC

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.",,PDC

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.",,PDC

The action started off with high winds and then heavy rain on the sixth.  Rainfall up to three inches caused widespread flooding, stranding motorists, and resulting in sporadic road closures.  The most serious flooding occurred in Newport Beach and Irvine during the early afternoon.  Several Newport  schools had flooded classrooms and were evacuated.  In Irvine, water and mud rushing through Bommer Canyon flooded 25 townhomes and a city park.  Lightning also struck a home in Irvine, blowing out windows, damaging the roof, and causing a gas line rupture.  In Dana Point, a tree-covered hillside slid into a hotel parking structure, submerging at least six cars in rock and sand.  Local State of Emergencies were declared in San Clemente, Laguna Beach, Dana Point, and Irvine.  Elsewhere throughout the valley areas of southwest California, several mud slides closed roads and blocked drainage channels, exacerbating the already high water levels.  Numerous swift-water and standing-water rescues were made as water quickly surrounded homes and cars. Gusty winds easily pushed over trees whose shallow root systems were anchored in water-logged soil, damaging homes and automobiles, and causing sporadic power outages.  Sink holes began to open up, undermining some roadways.  Over two inches of rain along the San Diego River late on the seventh and early on the eighth, sent the river out of it's banks.  It crested at 12.5 feet at Fashion Valley during the morning of the eighth, which is 1.2 feet above flood stage.

In addition, 6 single-family homes were destroyed 1.5 miles south of Lamont, while in the city of Lamont 3 single-family dwellings sustained major damage. Nine single-family homes sufferred minor damage. Nearly a dozen vehicles were destroyed, including automobiles, pickup trucks, farm trucks, and farm tractors. Several barns were destroyed including one barn where 30 sheep were also killed. More than 70 utility poles were ripped down in a 3 mile stretch.

The strongest tornado, an F3, occurred near Lamont in Grant County. There were also reports of hail up to 3.5 inches in diameter, straight line wind damage, and flooding. The first tornado, an F0, touched down in an open field 1 mile south of Amorita in Alfalfa County at 1745 CST lasting for less than one minute with no reports of damage. The second tornado, also an F0, was reported 5 minutes later by media chasers to have touched down in an open field 3 miles east northeast of Amorita. Touchdown was very brief with no damage reported. The third tornado was also observed by media chasers, this time in northeast Alfalfa County 8 miles east of Amorita. The tornado, an F1, damaged one house and knocked down power lines as it moved southeast and weakened while crossing into western Grant County for a total damage path lengh of 5 miles. There were no reports of damage with this segment of the tornado in Grant County and thus was rated an F0. An unusual aspect of this tornado was that it was reported to be rotating anticyclonically. The fourth and fifth tornadoes were also rated F0, the fourth reported by media chasers to have touched down in an open field 4 west northwest of Wakita with no damage, and the fifth observed by Wakita Fire Department to be on the ground for 2.5 miles from 2 miles southwest of Wakita to 2 miles south of Wakita. No damage was reported. An off-duty National Weather Service meteorologist observed the sixth tornado, an F0, in an open field 9 miles west of Medford. The seventh tornado, also an F0, produced no damage as it rotated anticyclonically 3 miles southeast of Wakita. The eighth and ninth tornadoes, both F0, occurred simultaneously 6 miles west of Medford. The eighth tornado touched down just north of Highway 11 while the ninth tornado touched down just south of Highway 11. One house and a business were damaged by the tenth tornado which occurred in Grant County from 2 miles southwest of Medford to 2 miles south of Medford.  The eleventh tornado, an F0, was observed by an off duty National Weather Service meteorologist to be knocking down trees and power lines in a 5 mile long damage path in southern Grant County. The twelvth tornado, an F1, snapped trees in half and damaged a private airstrip 4 miles east northeast of Pond Creek while the thirteenth tornado, also an F1, damaged several homes and knocked down trees and power lines 1 mile north of Salt Fork. The fourteenth tornado, an F0, was reported by spotters to have touched down briefly in an open field causing no damage.                          The most destructive tornado occurred near the city of Lamont where damage estimates reached 2 million dollars.  National Weather Service meteorologists conducted a survey of the area and found a damage path 5 1/4 miles long and 3/4 of a mile wide with F3 damage occurring 2 miles west of Lamont where a well-built brick home had all of its exterior walls destroyed. In addition, 6 single-family homes were destroyed 1.5 miles south of Lamont, while in the city of Lamont 3 single-family dwellings sustained major damage. Nine single-family homes sufferred minor damage. Nearly a dozen vehicles were destroyed, including automobiles, pickup trucks, farm trucks, and farm tractors. Several barns were destroyed including one barn where 30 sheep were also killed. More than 70 utility poles were ripped down in a 3 mile stretch. The Lamont tornado, as it is referred, was unusual in its direction of movement. Several eye witnesses reported a southeast to northwest movement. WSR-88D data also showed the mesocyclone associated with the tornado moving from south to north in a looping manner when the tornado was reported. The last tornado, the sixteenth of this episode, touched down briefly in an open field 5 miles northwest of Tonkawa at 2130 CST. Tonkawa Emergency Management reported no damage. Thus, this tornado was rated an F0.    In addition to these tornadoes, a large macroburst containing damaging straight-line winds occurred from 13 miles west of Medford (Grant County) to 4 miles west northwest of Pond Creek. Satellite dishes owned by Classic Cable Company, which were rated at 110 mph, were flattened by the winds. Straight-line wind damage was also reported in Alva where one man sustained minor injuries when he was blown into the bed of a pickup truck. Also in Alva at least 3 mobile homes suffered major damage; several carports were destroyed; awning and minor roof damage occurred to many homes; and trees and power lines were blown down. One indirect fatality occurred in Alva when a man slipped and suffered a heart attack while seeking shelter in a storm cellar. Other reports of straight-line wind damage include major roof damage to an old schoolhouse gymnasium in the city of Jefferson in Grant County. Two large cedar trees were also uprooted in Jefferson. A tree limb was blown through a picture window 14 miles north northeast of Camp Houston in Woods County. Windows were also blown out of a shed, and numerous trees were downed.

The twelvth tornado, an F1, snapped trees in half and damaged a private airstrip 4 miles east northeast of Pond Creek while the thirteenth tornado, also an F1, damaged several homes and knocked down trees and power lines 1 mile north of Salt Fork. The fourteenth tornado, an F0, was reported by spotters to have touched down briefly in an open field causing no damage.                          The most destructive tornado occurred near the city of Lamont where damage estimates reached 2 million dollars.  National Weather Service meteorologists conducted a survey of the area and found a damage path 5 1/4 miles long and 3/4 of a mile wide with F3 damage occurring 2 miles west of Lamont where a well-built brick home had all of its exterior walls destroyed. In addition, 6 single-family homes were destroyed 1.5 miles south of Lamont, while in the city of Lamont 3 single-family dwellings sustained major damage. Nine single-family homes sufferred minor damage. Nearly a dozen vehicles were destroyed, including automobiles, pickup trucks, farm trucks, and farm tractors. Several barns were destroyed including one barn where 30 sheep were also killed. More than 70 utility poles were ripped down in a 3 mile stretch. The Lamont tornado, as it is referred, was unusual in its direction of movement. Several eye witnesses reported a southeast to northwest movement. WSR-88D data also showed the mesocyclone associated with the tornado moving from south to north in a looping manner when the tornado was reported. The last tornado, the sixteenth of this episode, touched down briefly in an open field 5 miles northwest of Tonkawa at 2130 CST. Tonkawa Emergency Management reported no damage. Thus, this tornado was rated an F0.    In addition to these tornadoes, a large macroburst containing damaging straight-line winds occurred from 13 miles west of Medford (Grant County) to 4 miles west northwest of Pond Creek. Satellite dishes owned by Classic Cable Company, which were rated at 110 mph, were flattened by the winds. Straight-line wind damage was also reported in Alva where one man sustained minor injuries when he was blown into the bed of a pickup truck. Also in Alva at least 3 mobile homes suffered major damage; several carports were destroyed; awning and minor roof damage occurred to many homes; and trees and power lines were blown down. One indirect fatality occurred in Alva when a man slipped and suffered a heart attack while seeking shelter in a storm cellar. Other reports of straight-line wind damage include major roof damage to an old schoolhouse gymnasium in the city of Jefferson in Grant County. Two large cedar trees were also uprooted in Jefferson. A tree limb was blown through a picture window 14 miles north northeast of Camp Houston in Woods County. Windows were also blown out of a shed, and numerous trees were downed. Four to six inch tree limbs were blown down 9 miles west of Cherokee in Alfalfa County.  In Thomas in Custer County one utility pole was snapped and large limbs were blown down. Power lines were knocked down in Edmond in Oklahoma County. Severe winds also damaged the roof of the Fred Humphrey Pavillion in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County. The largest hail reported measured 3.5 inches in diameter and occurred in Medford in Grant County. Three reported events of at least tennis ball size hail occurred in Goltry (Alfalfa County) in less than 2 hours: tennis ball size hail at 2140 CST and 2230 CST, and baseball size hail at 2305 CST. Between 30 and 100 percent of the wheat crop was destroyed due to large hail from about 2 miles west of Jet to near Goltry. Another area south of Cherokee, near the junction of US 64 and SH 8 also sustained major wheat crop damage. In addition numerous vehicles had their windows broken. Tennis ball size hail also damaged the wheat crop and numerous vehicles in Okarche in Canadian County while in Watonga in Blaine County golf ball size hail damaged RV vehicles and street lights. Quarter size hail damaged several vehicles 6 miles north of Piedmont in Canadian County. Lightning struck a house in Piedmont causing a house to catch on fire. The last of the severe thunderstorms moved through northern Oklahoma during the early morning of May 25th, resulting in flooding near Cherokee and the National Wildlife Refuge in Alfalfa County, where 5.5 inches of rain fell. Several streets and the city park were also flooded in Blackwell in Kay County during the evening of May 24th.",,PDC

The strongest tornado, an F3, occurred near Lamont in Grant County. There were also reports of hail up to 3.5 inches in diameter, straight line wind damage, and flooding. The first tornado, an F0, touched down in an open field 1 mile south of Amorita in Alfalfa County at 1745 CST lasting for less than one minute with no reports of damage. The second tornado, also an F0, was reported 5 minutes later by media chasers to have touched down in an open field 3 miles east northeast of Amorita. Touchdown was very brief with no damage reported. The third tornado was also observed by media chasers, this time in northeast Alfalfa County 8 miles east of Amorita. The tornado, an F1, damaged one house and knocked down power lines as it moved southeast and weakened while crossing into western Grant County for a total damage path lengh of 5 miles. There were no reports of damage with this segment of the tornado in Grant County and thus was rated an F0. An unusual aspect of this tornado was that it was reported to be rotating anticyclonically. The fourth and fifth tornadoes were also rated F0, the fourth reported by media chasers to have touched down in an open field 4 west northwest of Wakita with no damage, and the fifth observed by Wakita Fire Department to be on the ground for 2.5 miles from 2 miles southwest of Wakita to 2 miles south of Wakita. No damage was reported. An off-duty National Weather Service meteorologist observed the sixth tornado, an F0, in an open field 9 miles west of Medford. The seventh tornado, also an F0, produced no damage as it rotated anticyclonically 3 miles southeast of Wakita. The eighth and ninth tornadoes, both F0, occurred simultaneously 6 miles west of Medford. The eighth tornado touched down just north of Highway 11 while the ninth tornado touched down just south of Highway 11. One house and a business were damaged by the tenth tornado which occurred in Grant County from 2 miles southwest of Medford to 2 miles south of Medford.  The eleventh tornado, an F0, was observed by an off duty National Weather Service meteorologist to be knocking down trees and power lines in a 5 mile long damage path in southern Grant County. The twelvth tornado, an F1, snapped trees in half and damaged a private airstrip 4 miles east northeast of Pond Creek while the thirteenth tornado, also an F1, damaged several homes and knocked down trees and power lines 1 mile north of Salt Fork. The fourteenth tornado, an F0, was reported by spotters to have touched down briefly in an open field causing no damage.                          The most destructive tornado occurred near the city of Lamont where damage estimates reached 2 million dollars.  National Weather Service meteorologists conducted a survey of the area and found a damage path 5 1/4 miles long and 3/4 of a mile wide with F3 damage occurring 2 miles west of Lamont where a well-built brick home had all of its exterior walls destroyed. In addition, 6 single-family homes were destroyed 1.5 miles south of Lamont, while in the city of Lamont 3 single-family dwellings sustained major damage. Nine single-family homes sufferred minor damage. Nearly a dozen vehicles were destroyed, including automobiles, pickup trucks, farm trucks, and farm tractors. Several barns were destroyed including one barn where 30 sheep were also killed. More than 70 utility poles were ripped down in a 3 mile stretch. The Lamont tornado, as it is referred, was unusual in its direction of movement. Several eye witnesses reported a southeast to northwest movement. WSR-88D data also showed the mesocyclone associated with the tornado moving from south to north in a looping manner when the tornado was reported. The last tornado, the sixteenth of this episode, touched down briefly in an open field 5 miles northwest of Tonkawa at 2130 CST. Tonkawa Emergency Management reported no damage. Thus, this tornado was rated an F0.    In addition to these tornadoes, a large macroburst containing damaging straight-line winds occurred from 13 miles west of Medford (Grant County) to 4 miles west northwest of Pond Creek. Satellite dishes owned by Classic Cable Company, which were rated at 110 mph, were flattened by the winds. Straight-line wind damage was also reported in Alva where one man sustained minor injuries when he was blown into the bed of a pickup truck. Also in Alva at least 3 mobile homes suffered major damage; several carports were destroyed; awning and minor roof damage occurred to many homes; and trees and power lines were blown down. One indirect fatality occurred in Alva when a man slipped and suffered a heart attack while seeking shelter in a storm cellar. Other reports of straight-line wind damage include major roof damage to an old schoolhouse gymnasium in the city of Jefferson in Grant County. Two large cedar trees were also uprooted in Jefferson. A tree limb was blown through a picture window 14 miles north northeast of Camp Houston in Woods County. Windows were also blown out of a shed, and numerous trees were downed. Four to six inch tree limbs were blown down 9 miles west of Cherokee in Alfalfa County.  In Thomas in Custer County one utility pole was snapped and large limbs were blown down. Power lines were knocked down in Edmond in Oklahoma County. Severe winds also damaged the roof of the Fred Humphrey Pavillion in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County.

Three reported events of at least tennis ball size hail occurred in Goltry (Alfalfa County) in less than 2 hours: tennis ball size hail at 2140 CST and 2230 CST, and baseball size hail at 2305 CST. Between 30 and 100 percent of the wheat crop was destroyed due to large hail from about 2 miles west of Jet to near Goltry. Another area south of Cherokee, near the junction of US 64 and SH 8 also sustained major wheat crop damage. In addition numerous vehicles had their windows broken. Tennis ball size hail also damaged the wheat crop and numerous vehicles in Okarche in Canadian County while in Watonga in Blaine County golf ball size hail damaged RV vehicles and street lights. Quarter size hail damaged several vehicles 6 miles north of Piedmont in Canadian County. Lightning struck a house in Piedmont causing a house to catch on fire.

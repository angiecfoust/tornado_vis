Photographs of this developing tornado indicate a generally-long and rope-shaped structure that slowly twisted and wound its way to the surface.  The tornado touched down in the western part of Mason Creek Subdivision located on the west side of Leander and moved slowly eastward.  Damage near the tornado touchdown  was F0 level approaching F1.  It damaged eaves of roofs, took shingles off roofs and knocked down large tree branches.  More significant damage was noted along Greening Way and Mason Creek Boulevard in the west and central part of the subdivision, where several large trees of over 1 foot diameter were uprooted.  This indicated damage in the lower levels of the F2 scale.  In addition, the tornado had destroyed approximately 30 percent of one home.   Again, this indicated minimal F2-level damage.   The tornado began to lift as it approached Old Bagdad Road on the eastern side of the subdivision.  Most of the damage in this part of the subdivision was at the F0 level.

The city of Milwaukee recorded it's earliest tornado ever (just before sunset), and an extremely large number of reports of large hail from 3/4 to 1.75 inches in diameter were relayed to the NWS Sullivan office.  Most of the thunderstorms developed gusty winds on the order of 30 to 50 mph, but one managed to generate a gust of 58 knots (67 mph) at the TV-4 station on the north side of Milwaukee.  The thunderstorm which dumped large hail 7 N of Portage also had winds that uprooted some trees and blew a car off of Inerstate 39.  An earlier thunderstorm that affected the west side of the city of Portage left the ground white with golf-ball size hail that also shattered several  vehicle windshields.  The thunderstorm that affected Wisconsin Dells also left the ground white with hail. The Milwaukee tornado spun up about 1/2 mile east/northeast of the terminal building of General Mitchell International Airport, just east of Runway 19, moved northeast and crossed East Layton Avenue just east of South Pennsylvania Avenue in Cudahy, continued northeast through St. Francis, and dissipated over the northwest corner of Nathanael Greene Park.  Apparently the tornado wasn't strong enough to cause any damage on the airport grounds, but it did cause considerable damage in Cudahy and St. Francis.  Fifty-three (53) residental homes sustained minor damage and eleven (11) had major damage. Eight (8) businesses sustained major damage.  Many motor vehicles were over-turned, several roofs were partially peeled off of homes, power lines and trees were toppled, and gas leaks were reported. Sixteen (16) people were injured enough to require medical treatment (lacerations), but there were no fatilities.  Most of the people who were injured were in their vehicles.  Based on this damage, it is estimated that maximum wind speeds of this tornado were 105 to 110 mph. The airport terminal building and control tower went on emergency power after commercial power was disrupted.  Airport control tower officials were able to divert airplane traffic, consequently there were no aircraft mishaps.  Preceding the tornado, there were reports of large hail and some tree damage in the forward flank downdraft of the parent thunderstorm over St. Francis and the southern part of the city of Milwaukee.  The tornado was extensively photographed and captured on video tape.  It briefly displayed multiple-vortex characterisitics.  The last time a tornado was documented in Milwaukee County was in May, 1989.NWS Sullivan meteorologists speculate that an outflow boundary was pushed northwest to the airport area from a thunderstorm that earlier moved through the southeast corner of Milwaukee County. This outflow boundary may have focused low-level vorticity that helped generate the tornado.  The parent thunderstorm possessed a mesocyclone.  Synoptically, a deep low pressure was moving northeast through central Iowa toward northern Wisconsin.  This movement put southern Wisconsin in a ""dry slot"" associated with strong jet stream winds aloft.  The combination of surface dewpoints in the lower to mid 50s, strong speed shear between surface winds out of the south and southwest mid-level winds, sufficient instability due to daytime heating/temperatures in the 70s, and cold air aloft allowed thunderstorms to grow to 40,000 feet. Several thunderstorms had supercell characturistics, but only one was assoicated with a tornado, and another with a funnel cloud.

At Roane, one barn was destroyed, and another unroofed by a brief tornado ($10K) (1955C). The storm eventually produced another tornado near the small community of Bazette (around 2015CST), destroying three mobile homes, five barns, and damaging the roofs of two homes ($200K). The storm then moved across the Trinity River, downing trees and producing minor damage to a few residences at Trinidad. One resident took shelter after seeing a funnel, and after hearing a roar, went outside to find a tree blown over on their house (2030CST).

More significant damage was noted along Greening Way and Mason Creek Boulevard in the west and central part of the subdivision, where several large trees of over 1 foot diameter were uprooted.

The strongest storm, a supercell, passed through Calvert County and spawned an F1 tornado about 1 mile southeast of Dunkirk.  The tornado had a width of 75 yards, traveled on the ground for 1 1/2 miles and was responsible for over $200,000 worth of damage.  The first building struck by the twister around 3:40 PM EDT was a private school under construction on Mt. Harmony Road about 1/2 mile east of Route 4. The tornado damaged 3 sections of an 8 to 10 ton reinforced brick wall and removed a 30 foot section of roof. Two windows on cars in a nearby parking lot were blown out.  An old wooden barn about 600 yards from the school was also destroyed. The tornado moved east-northeast for about a mile, damaging trees and causing minor home damage along its path as it crossed through Cattertons Reach and Megatha Lane.  The tornado dissipated near the intersection of Chesapeake Road West and Route 2 (Solomons Island Road) at 3:45 PM EDT.  In addition to the tornado damage, a barn filled with farm equipment across from Mt. Harmony Elementary School near Dunkirk was destroyed by downburst winds.  Also, Mid Bay buoy east of St. Leonard recorded a wind gust near 90 knots around 4:00 PM EDT as the same storm moved across the Chesapeake Bay.  Before the supercell became tornadic near Dunkirk, it passed through northern Charles County.  Winds in excess of 55 MPH produced over $50,000 worth of damage. At the intersection of Bensville Road and Courtney Drive west of Waldorf, straight line winds destroyed a two story home under construction around 3:05 PM. Quarter sized hail was reported and ten trees within one half mile of the home were also damaged. Quarter sized hail also fell in White Plains and Waldorf.  A resident of St. Charles reported a funnel cloud at the intersection of St. Charles Parkway and Smallwood Drive at 3:07 PM EDT. Additional thunderstorms moved across Central Maryland between 2 and 7 PM EDT.  In Prince George's County, a postal worker in Clinton was injured around 3:15 PM EDT when lightning struck near her.  Pea sized hail was reported in Accokeek and Clinton.  A motorist near College Park reported seeing a funnel cloud around 4:45 PM EDT. Nickel sized hail fell in Rosaryville. In Charles County, quarter sized hail fell in Lynnbrook around 6:00 PM EDT. Quarter sized hail was also reported in extreme northwest Calvert County around 6:15 PM EDT. In Montgomery County, quarter sized hail fell in Germantown, Rockville, and Wheaton.  Dime sized hail fell in Layhill and Colesville, and half dollar sized hail fell in Gaithersburg.  The volume of hail resulted in accumulations of 3 to 4 inches on lawns and roadways, with drifts up to 10 inches against buildings and fences.  Trees were stripped of leaves, small dents were found on cars, and one neighborhood in Gaithersburg reported chipped paint on homes.  In Howard County, golf ball sized hail fell in Columbia.  In Baltimore County, pea sized hail was reported in Brookland at 5:43 PM EDT.  In Washington County, quarter sized hail fell on the north side of Hagerstown and minor stream flooding was reported after heavy downpours in Hancock. Heavy rain and strong east winds over the Chesapeake Bay also led to tidal flooding in Annapolis Harbor on the morning of the 21st.  Several roads near the City Dock area were flooded with up to 2 feet of water around high tide.  Water poured over the seawall forcing police to barricade Dock Street and to close Compromise Street.

At the same time, very strong winds aloft moved over the area. The combination of the instability, and lift ahead of the front, spawned a line of thunderstorms. These storm tapped into the strong wind aloft, to produce the largest outbreak of severe weather across eastern New York in nearly two years. While the vast majority of damage was from thunderstorm winds, there was also some hail damage reported, along with two confirmed tornadoes. It was the first time since June 1998 that a tornado was officially confirmed in eastern New York. 	Thunderstorm winds knocked down large trees a powerlines at several locations in Albany, Columbia, Greene, Montgomery, Saratoga, Schoharie and Ulster counties. Dutchess county was especially hard hit. 	A line of strong to locally severe thunderstorms first moved into Montgomery County during the mid afternoon. Strong winds blew down large trees in Fort Plain. Then a microburst produced a swath of damage, 8 miles long, from west to east in the town of Canajoharie. The swath began at the intersection of Nestle and Clinton roads where a large barn lost its roof and two sides. Debris was blown over the adjoining house, landing inside a garage on the other side of the intersection, as well as up the roadabout 40 feet .  A wooden silo located adjacent to the garage lost one entire side, thus collapsing inward inside the silo. The rest of the damage was mainly from snapped power poles and trees, as the path ended just west of Knauderack Creek, adjacent to Bower road.	Trees and powerlines came down in Selkirk, Albany county, as well as Gilboa and Jefferson in Schoharie county. 	At Ballston Lake, in Saratoga county, a microburst sheared off 8 forty-foot trees at the 10 to 20 foot level. One tree damaged a house. More trees and limbs fell in Clifton Park. 	Another series of microbursts began in Ulster county about a mile northwest of the center of Esopus. They knocked down several clusters of trees as they neared State HIghway Route 9W, while moving in an easterly direction. Embedded within the microburst, an F1 tornado, touched down briefly to the east of Black Creek and 9W, less than a tenth of a mile south of the center of Esopus. The track of the tornado was about a quarter mile long and 25 to 50 yards wide with numerous trees pushed about 70 degrees to the left of the storm track. There was little property damage due to the tornado, but it was sighted by nearby residents. Meanwhile the series of microbursts continued across the Hudson river, into Dutchess county, blowing over over the estreme southern portion of Hydeo Park as well as the Poughkeepsie Yacht club in northern Poughkeepsie. Winds were clocked at 126 mph at the Poughkeepsie Yacht club. Several boats were overturned and damaged. A trailer was overturned. The roof was removed from the Yacht club. Damage from this microburst fanned out to a width of approximately one hundred yards, and a path length of up to a quarter of a mile.  The wind overturned a car. The roof was removed from the Yacht club. Damage from this microburst fanned out to a width of approximatley 100 yards, and a path length of up to a quarter of a mile. A car was damaged by a falling tree in Hyde Park. 	A weaker F0 tornado, touched down in the Fairview section of the town of Poughkeepsie, about one quarter mile east of the Fairview Fire Station, on the leading edge of another microburst. The width was 25 yards, the length less than one hundred yards. Damage from the tornado was marginal, confined to downed trees and some minor structural damage to seven homes. 	Thunderstorm winds produced damage in many other portions of Dutchess county. Another microburst produced damage between County Route 83, just north of U.S. Highway Route 44, east to the village of Leedsville. Damage included destruction to a barn on the Bel Air farm. Many trees were down in a huge swath with this microburst. There were unconfirmed sightings of  funnel clouds in this area.  Many trees fell in Millbrook, which was described as a war zone. Large trees were uprooted in Clinton Corners and falling trees knocked powerlines down in Rhinebeck. In Pawling, a large tree fell on power lines, then crashed onto a car, causing extensive damage. Trees were blown across a power line, which then fell on  Allyn's restaurant in the Town of Washington. Trees and poles were also blown down in the village of Fishkill. 	Winds were clocked to 70 mph in Stone Ridge, and 60 mph at New Paltz, both in Ulster county. Many windows were smashed or blown out of buildings at the New Paltz S.U.N.Y. campus. Trees were blown over in Ellenville. A tree fell on the mayor's car in that town, destroying it. Another tree damaged a historical home.	A 60 mph wind gust was also recoreded at Kinderhook, Columbia county. Two 50-foot concrete silos of a coach barn in Gallatin, Columbia county were obliterated. A door was blown off a nearby house. In the promixity of Gallatin, a car was destroyed by a fallen tree. Huge trees fell on Schneider road in Columbia county. Many trees were snapped off their bases in East Taghkanic. Shingles from a roof  were blown off in Cairo, Greene county and large trees fell on a house in and around the town of Phoenicia. A microburst uprooted many 22 to 24 inch diameter trees and snapped utility lines in the vicinity of Route 23, a few hundred yards north of the intersection of County Route 23A.  	Dime size hail fell at Kerhonkson, Ulster county. Pea-size hail was noted at Tivoli and Clinton corners, both located in Dutchess county. While property damage with the hail was minimized, hail took a toll on apple orchards. Many apples were partially damaged by small hail in Ulster and Dutchess counties that produced permanent indentations on the apples, making them unusable for sale. Total crop damage could easily exceed a million dollars.	Lightning took the life of two horses at a farm in Ballston Lake.	 At the height of the storms, up to 52,000 customers, mainly in the Mid Hudson Valley region, were without power. 	A funnel cloud was noted by two on-duty meteorologists at the National Weather Service office at Albany. 	There were no human injuries or casualties, reported to the National Weather Service,  in association with this large severe outbreak.",,PDC

Temperatures during the afternoon climbed well into the 90s and low 100s over Southwest Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable with surface based CAPE values in excess of 4000 J/Kg.  Strong shear  created a favorable environment for supercell development.  Convergence to the east of the surface low sufficiently eroded the cap by late afternoon, leading to explosive development of an isolated supercell near Waterloo.  This supercell produced a tornado in Dunkerton in Black Hawk County, which did extensive damage.  This same tornado weakened as it moved into Buchanan County.  Other weak tornadoes were spawned in Buchanan County.  There were also indications of scattered damage produced by downbursts with the second and fourth tornadoes.  Iowa governor Tom Vilsack signed a proclamation declaring Black Hawk and Buchanan Counties disaster areas.  Damage was estimated at over 1 million dollars.  Most of the damage in Buchanan County came on four farms.  The damage was spread along an eight mile stretch south of Hazelton.  Machine sheds, grain bins and outbuildings were blown apart.

At the same time, very strong winds aloft moved over the area. The combination of the instability, and lift ahead of the front, spawned a line of thunderstorms. These storm tapped into the strong wind aloft, to produce the largest outbreak of severe weather across eastern New York in nearly two years. While the vast majority of damage was from thunderstorm winds, there was also some hail damage reported, along with two confirmed tornadoes. It was the first time since June 1998 that a tornado was officially confirmed in eastern New York. 	Thunderstorm winds knocked down large trees a powerlines at several locations in Albany, Columbia, Greene, Montgomery, Saratoga, Schoharie and Ulster counties. Dutchess county was especially hard hit. 	A line of strong to locally severe thunderstorms first moved into Montgomery County during the mid afternoon. Strong winds blew down large trees in Fort Plain. Then a microburst produced a swath of damage, 8 miles long, from west to east in the town of Canajoharie. The swath began at the intersection of Nestle and Clinton roads where a large barn lost its roof and two sides. Debris was blown over the adjoining house, landing inside a garage on the other side of the intersection, as well as up the roadabout 40 feet .  A wooden silo located adjacent to the garage lost one entire side, thus collapsing inward inside the silo. The rest of the damage was mainly from snapped power poles and trees, as the path ended just west of Knauderack Creek, adjacent to Bower road.	Trees and powerlines came down in Selkirk, Albany county, as well as Gilboa and Jefferson in Schoharie county. 	At Ballston Lake, in Saratoga county, a microburst sheared off 8 forty-foot trees at the 10 to 20 foot level. One tree damaged a house. More trees and limbs fell in Clifton Park. 	Another series of microbursts began in Ulster county about a mile northwest of the center of Esopus. They knocked down several clusters of trees as they neared State HIghway Route 9W, while moving in an easterly direction. Embedded within the microburst, an F1 tornado, touched down briefly to the east of Black Creek and 9W, less than a tenth of a mile south of the center of Esopus. The track of the tornado was about a quarter mile long and 25 to 50 yards wide with numerous trees pushed about 70 degrees to the left of the storm track. There was little property damage due to the tornado, but it was sighted by nearby residents. Meanwhile the series of microbursts continued across the Hudson river, into Dutchess county, blowing over over the estreme southern portion of Hydeo Park as well as the Poughkeepsie Yacht club in northern Poughkeepsie. Winds were clocked at 126 mph at the Poughkeepsie Yacht club. Several boats were overturned and damaged. A trailer was overturned. The roof was removed from the Yacht club. Damage from this microburst fanned out to a width of approximately one hundred yards, and a path length of up to a quarter of a mile.  The wind overturned a car. The roof was removed from the Yacht club. Damage from this microburst fanned out to a width of approximatley 100 yards, and a path length of up to a quarter of a mile. A car was damaged by a falling tree in Hyde Park. 	A weaker F0 tornado, touched down in the Fairview section of the town of Poughkeepsie, about one quarter mile east of the Fairview Fire Station, on the leading edge of another microburst. The width was 25 yards, the length less than one hundred yards. Damage from the tornado was marginal, confined to downed trees and some minor structural damage to seven homes. 	Thunderstorm winds produced damage in many other portions of Dutchess county. Another microburst produced damage between County Route 83, just north of U.S. Highway Route 44, east to the village of Leedsville. Damage included destruction to a barn on the Bel Air farm. Many trees were down in a huge swath with this microburst. There were unconfirmed sightings of  funnel clouds in this area.  Many trees fell in Millbrook, which was described as a war zone. Large trees were uprooted in Clinton Corners and falling trees knocked powerlines down in Rhinebeck. In Pawling, a large tree fell on power lines, then crashed onto a car, causing extensive damage. Trees were blown across a power line, which then fell on  Allyn's restaurant in the Town of Washington. Trees and poles were also blown down in the village of Fishkill. 	Winds were clocked to 70 mph in Stone Ridge, and 60 mph at New Paltz, both in Ulster county. Many windows were smashed or blown out of buildings at the New Paltz S.U.N.Y. campus. Trees were blown over in Ellenville. A tree fell on the mayor's car in that town, destroying it. Another tree damaged a historical home.	A 60 mph wind gust was also recoreded at Kinderhook, Columbia county. Two 50-foot concrete silos of a coach barn in Gallatin, Columbia county were obliterated. A door was blown off a nearby house. In the promixity of Gallatin, a car was destroyed by a fallen tree. Huge trees fell on Schneider road in Columbia county. Many trees were snapped off their bases in East Taghkanic. Shingles from a roof  were blown off in Cairo, Greene county and large trees fell on a house in and around the town of Phoenicia. A microburst uprooted many 22 to 24 inch diameter trees and snapped utility lines in the vicinity of Route 23, a few hundred yards north of the intersection of County Route 23A.  	Dime size hail fell at Kerhonkson, Ulster county. Pea-size hail was noted at Tivoli and Clinton corners, both located in Dutchess county. While property damage with the hail was minimized, hail took a toll on apple orchards. Many apples were partially damaged by small hail in Ulster and Dutchess counties that produced permanent indentations on the apples, making them unusable for sale. Total crop damage could easily exceed a million dollars.	Lightning took the life of two horses at a farm in Ballston Lake.	 At the height of the storms, up to 52,000 customers, mainly in the Mid Hudson Valley region, were without power. 	A funnel cloud was noted by two on-duty meteorologists at the National Weather Service office at Albany. 	There were no human injuries or casualties, reported to the National Weather Service,  in association with this large severe outbreak.",,PDC

An elevated bow MCS (Mesoscale Convective System) developed between Mason City and Marshalltown, and raced eastward into Eastern Iowa during the late morning and early afternoon.  This system packed high winds and heavy rain as it swept across Eastern Iowa, mainly along and north of Interstate 80.  Winds were measured at 60 to 70 mph over portions of the area, knocking down trees and limbs.  Recent rains had already saturated the ground throughout Northeast and East Central Iowa. Additional heavy rain with this system forced creeks and streams out of their banks in Buchanan County, washing out several roads.  The Little Wapsipinicon River at Fairbank was also sent out of it's banks. Doppler radar estimated rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour.  The heavy rain also caused Duck Creek in Davenport to rise to bankfull in areas, and flooded portions of the bike path and surrounding areas near Brady Street. The bow MCS also spawned two weak tornadoes, one which touched down briefly at Alburnett in Linn County, and the other at Center Junction in Jones County.","A tornado touched down at Alburnett causing damage.  The center section of the horse barn roof at Strand Arabian Stables was torn off.  Sheet metal from the horse barn roof littered surrounding yards, and one woman was cut by the sheet metal.

Several large bales of hay also rolled westward approximately 125 feet and were embedded in structure and tree debris. Damage to the Green Valley Community Center 6 miles SSW of Dacoma is the basis for the F2 rating. As the accompanying photo (below listing of tornado at 2225 CST) shows, this building was completely destroyed with most of the debris found to the northwest of the foundation. As the tornado tracked northeastward, a 1 mile long path of tree damage was evident on both sides of EW29 Road. Most trees had numerous limbs blown off or were damaged, while fewer trees were blown over, with the majority of trees north of the road blown over to the north and trees south of the road blown over to the east. Minor structural damage was also observed about 1/4 mile south of EW29 Road. Along NS249 Road an uninhabited house sustained significant damage to the east portion thought to be a garage, which was pushed over to the north. Numerous shingles were missing from the remainder of the house roof. A flag pole on the west side of the lot was bent to the northwest, while dozens of large mature trees north and northeast of the house were heavily damaged, with most of the them missing numerous limbs, while others were pushed over. This tree damage continued northward to EW27 Road. On the southeast side of Dacoma, an old barn was blown over, while another barn of tin construction had part of its roof blown off, with debris scattered northward a short distance. The tornado dissipated 1 mile east-northeast of Dacoma where 3-4 inch diameter tree limbs were downed.",PDC

There was also damage to an oil storage tank made of metal. A telephone pole at the intersection was recently replaced and is assumed to have been downed during the tornado. A west to east chain link fence approximately 100 to 200 feet long was also downed southward. Major tree damage was then observed at a property about ½ mile northeast of this location with many trees laying in a westward direction. A well-designed brick home near the trees, lost dozens perhaps hundreds of shingles, especially on the west side of the house. About 1 mile northeast of this location another house sustained a broken window on the north side of the house and minor roof damage, consisting mostly of missing roof shingles. Metal siding was partially peeled back from a nearby storage barn, and a medium-aged pine tree on the west side of the house was snapped halfway to the top. Near the intersection of EW27 Road and NS262 Road damage was observed to 2 metal barns. One barn had sheet metal peeled back on the roof and west and east sides. The roof of a storage building was also blown off in an eastward direction and left nearly intact on the ground. About ½ to 1 mile north and east of this location a poorly constructed barn sustained minor roof and west-side wall damage, while another barn constructed of metal had its 2 west-facing doors blown inward and partially detached from its hinges.

The strength of the system was more typical for for mid April rather than mid May.  An intense low pressure center developed over the central Rockies.  A warm front extended east from the low across Iowa.  To the south of the warm front, humid air was in place with dew point temperatures in the mid 60s to around 70.  Strong winds above the surface lifted the moist and unstable air over the top of the front.  Initially a round of thunderstorms fired north of the front.  The line became severe quite quickly and produced hail of three quarters of an inch to one and one quarter inch in diameter.  This east to west line of storms produced a strong outflow boundary that propagated south across the central and southern counties of the state.  By late morning, a round of thunderstorms developed over southern Iowa as the upper level low pressure system advanced into southwest Iowa.  The storms became severe as they moved north, then intensified even more as the line of storms from southern Iowa interacted with the outflow boundary from the storms to the north.  The storms produced several tornadoes, however most of them were very small and could be best described as spinup tornadoes.  The strongest one formed at the intersection of the of the line of storms and the outflow boundary in the Des Moines metro area.   A tornado touched down in Warren County east of Hartford.  This tornado was on the ground for a couple of miles, though did little damage as it was in open country moving from Warren into Marion County.   Another small tornado touched down in Poweshiek County south of Deep Rock.  It formed along the boundary with a strong updraft into the parent cumulonimbus cloud.  The dirt it picked up made it visually apparent even though there was no condensation funnel visible.  The greatest damage occurred from the hail.  Many of the storms produced one inch or larger diameter hail.  The storm that developed southeast of Des Moines and spawned the largest tornado also produced very large hail.  Hail up to baseball size was reported in Jasper County in a few places, with one report of three inch diameter hail southeast of Prairie City.  Some areas reported a hail depth of 3 inches, with drifts a few feet deep, after the storm had passed.  The hail was still on the ground six hours after the storm moved through.  Needless to say, the hail caused considerable damage to cars and roofs in the area.  With the exception of the tornadoes, there was not a great deal of wind associated with the storms.  Most of the wind gusts were under 40 MPH.  One of the storms did  produce a wind gust of around 60 MPH in the Waterloo area.","Small ropelike tornado, however not a gustnado for sure.",PDC

This system packed high winds and heavy rain as it swept across Eastern Iowa, mainly along and north of Interstate 80.  Winds were measured at 60 to 70 mph over portions of the area, knocking down trees and limbs.  Recent rains had already saturated the ground throughout Northeast and East Central Iowa.

The Little Wapsipinicon River at Fairbank was also sent out of it's banks. Doppler radar estimated rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour.  The heavy rain also caused Duck Creek in Davenport to rise to bankfull in areas, and flooded portions of the bike path and surrounding areas near Brady Street.

Temperatures during the afternoon climbed well into the 90s and low 100s over Southwest Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable with surface based CAPE values in excess of 4000 J/Kg.  Strong shear  created a favorable environment for supercell development.  Convergence to the east of the surface low sufficiently eroded the cap by late afternoon, leading to explosive development of an isolated supercell near Waterloo.  This supercell produced a tornado in Dunkerton in Black Hawk County, which did extensive damage.  This same tornado weakened as it moved into Buchanan County.  Other weak tornadoes were spawned in Buchanan County.  There were also indications of scattered damage produced by downbursts with the second and fourth tornadoes.  Iowa governor Tom Vilsack signed a proclamation declaring Black Hawk and Buchanan Counties disaster areas.  Damage was estimated at over 1 million dollars.

This supercell produced a tornado in Dunkerton in Black Hawk County, which did extensive damage.  This same tornado weakened as it moved into Buchanan County.  Other weak tornadoes were spawned in Buchanan County.  There were also indications of scattered damage produced by downbursts with the second and fourth tornadoes.  Iowa governor Tom Vilsack signed a proclamation declaring Black Hawk and Buchanan Counties disaster areas.  Damage was estimated at over 1 million dollars.  Most of the damage in Buchanan County came on four farms.  The damage was spread along an eight mile stretch south of Hazelton.  Machine sheds, grain bins and outbuildings were blown apart.  Damage also occurred to farm equipment with minor damage to a few houses.","A weak tornado, which produced no damage in Buchanan County, moved into the extreme northwest part of the county from Black Hawk County around 8 pm CDT.  The tornado was rated an F0 with an estimated path length of 2 miles.  This is likely the decaying stage of the tornado which hit Dunkerton in Black Hawk County.",PDC

During the day, very strong warm air advection took place.  Temperatures warmed rapidly  during the day with highs reaching the mid to upper 90s over about the southwest half of the state.  Dew point temperatures were in the upper 60s to low 70s.  This combination produced CAPE values in excess of 8000 J/kg.  During the afternoon, a strong cap was in place with 700 mb temperatures around +16 C.  This prevented convection from firing during the afternoon.  Toward evening, thunderstorms broke through the cap over northeast Iowa.  The storms went from initial echo to tornadic storms in less than 50 minutes.  A supercell formed west of the Waterloo area.  This cell became a splitting cell and produced a brief tornado in Grundy County as the right moving cell split off, and golf ball size hail in Bremer County from the left moving cell.  The cell moved off quickly, however additional supercells back developed over the same area.  the strongest tornado developed in the Cedar Falls area and tracked across the northern portions of Waterloo.  This cell produced a strong tornado which was actually a multi-vortex tornado based on reports from storm chasers in the area.  At one point, west of Dunkerton, three tornadoes each one quarter mile wide were on the ground with this storm.  The tornado damaged several houses and a few farmsteads along the way.  Reports indicated between 5 and 10 houses in Black Hawk County were totally destroyed, and another 15 to 20 sustained significant damage.  A total of at least 41 structures sustained at least some damage.  In addition to the tornado, damage also occurred south of the track as RFD winds estimated as high as 100 MPH were observed.  Dunkerton was hard hit as the tornado moved through.  Heavy damage was reported at a coop elevator in Dunkerton, with 10 of 16 grain elevators damaged.  A roof was removed from a church as well, resulting in about $500,000 damage.  The City Hall building was destroyed in Dunkerton.  The City Hall was housed in a series of double wide trailers since ironically the former City Hall building was destroyed just last year in the floods of '99.  As the tornado moved through the fairly densely populated area, numerous injuries were reported.  Some of the injuries were severe with limbs being cut off by flying debris.  One woman lost both one arm and one hand, and had her back broken.  She passed away 17 days after her injuries occurred.  Six of the injuries occurred at a nursing home that was hit by the tornado.  They occurred as the 139 residents were being evacuated.  Reports indicated the width of the tornado was up to three-quarters of a mile at its widest.  The damage path from the storm was around one and one half miles wide.  The tornado continued moving east and crossed into Buchanan County, about 4 miles northeast of Dunkerton.  A short time later, another cell developed in the Dunkerton area and dropped a tornado.  That tornado struck a farm northwest of town, destroying the farm house and seven outbuildings.  In addition to the damage that occurred to the structures, the family dog and one of the five horses on the farm were killed.  Reports indicate a letter from one of the farm houses destroyed was found 60 miles away from Dunkerton in the town of Monona in Clayton County.  Polly Mill's rural Dunkerton farmhouse was shredded by the tornado.  She lost some of her late husband's military medals, pages out of the family Bible, and part of her collection of letters and first-issue stamps.  Sixty miles away, on a farm east of Monona, the letter was found in an envelope carrying a first-day issue, 5-cent stamp commemorating the Battle of New Orleans.  There was yet a third round of tornadic storms in the Dunkerton area.  The last tornado touched down near Dunkerton and developed southward.  Two houses in the town of Dunkerton were destroyed by this tornado.  In addition to the tornadoes, very heavy rain fell in a narrow area of Black Hawk County.  Reports of 3 inches or more of rain was received from the area.  Soil conditions were very dry at the time.  The dry soil conditions helped preclude any significant flooding.

A nearly stationary front extended from Wisconsin, southwest through the northwest corner of Iowa, and into northern Kansas.  A round of convection moved across the state during the morning, leaving behind several outflow boundaries.  The mid levels of the atmosphere were quite warm, thus convection was capped during the afternoon hours.  A strong southerly flow of moist air spread into Iowa during the afternoon.  Temperatures approached 100 degrees F. over southwest Iowa.  Dew point temperatures reached the upper 60s to mid 70s across much of the south two thirds of the state.  Thunderstorms developed at the intersection of two outflow boundaries northwest of Des Moines, and also just ahead of the stationary front.  Surface based CAPE values were well over 5000 J/kg, thus the convection developed explosively.  Severe weather quickly followed.  There were numerous reports of hail.  Most of the hail was between one inch in diameter and golf ball size.  One of the cells, which happened to be the initial cell that formed at the boundary intersection, turned into a supercell.  Several tornadoes were spawned by this regenerating cell.  Most of the tornadoes were very weak and short lived.  The exception was one fairly small tornado that touched down on the northeast side of Des Moines.  This tornado tracked through mostly open area and caused little damage on its nearly 10 mile intermittent trek into Altoona.  Gusty winds were reported with many of the cells, however wind speeds were not all that great in most cases.  There was one report of 60 MPH winds as the storms passed through the Saylorville area in Polk County.  Heavy rain fell in a couple parts of the state.  One was with the supercell in Polk County, the other area of heavy rain was in Black Hawk County.  Rainfall amounts in parts of these two counties were in the two to four inch range, however little more than urban and small street flooding occurred due to dry soil conditions.",Brief touchdown,PDC

A dynamic upper level system approached Iowa from the northwest during the afternoon.  Several boundaries were in the area resulting from weak convection that took place during the morning.  Very strong theta-e advection took place over northeast Nebraska during the morning and early afternoon hours.  In addition, several other factors came into play.  Moisture continued to stream into Iowa from the remnants of Hurricane Carlotta as precipitable water values approached 2.2 inches.  Iowa was also under the influence of a coupled jet structure.  As a result a strong upper level divergent field was in place over the state.  By afternoon, mid and upper level cold air advection began to take place as well.  Strong convection took place by mid day over northeast Nebraska into west central Iowa.   The line of thunderstorms moved into rich air with surface dew points in the low to mid 70s.  The main feature with the storms was high winds.  The line of thunderstorms took on a bow echo configuration as it moved across southern Iowa.  Most of the southern three tiers of counties reported high winds.  Wind speeds of 60 to as much as 85 MPH were reported with the storms.  Wind speeds topped out at 85 MPH at New Virginia, in Warren County.  Damage was widespread with numerous trees and power lines downed by the winds.  Some trees up to 2 feet in diameter were snapped.  A flag pole was reported bent 4 inches by the high winds as well.  One tornado was reported in Warren County as well.  This was a brief tornado near St Marys which caused no damage.  The other problem with the storms was the heavy rainfall.  Two to three inches of rain fell in many areas.  As the storms moved into parts of south central and southeast Iowa, they moved into area that had been inundated by heavy rainfall just two nights before.  Flash flooding was reported in Appanoose, Lucas, Mahaska, Monroe, Wayne, Davis, and Wapello Counties.  Numerous roads were under water in these counties.    U.S. Highway 63 was closed by high water  north of Ottumwa.  Some of the worst flooding took place in Mahaska County where heavy rain fell on areas that had been flooded two days before.  At least 15 roads were reported under water in the county.  As the thunderstorms moved through Hamilton County, lightning struck a tree outside of a house in Stratford.  It also left a hole in the ground and caused damage inside the house.  The lightning strike broke windows out of the front of the house and also caused windows to break in the house next door.  Later, the storms moved into the Waterloo area.  Lightning struck the chimney of a former school building.

Mesoanalysis during the late afternoon showed low pressure west of Des Moines, with a warm front extending eastward across Northern Iowa into Southern Wisconsin.  Temperatures during the afternoon climbed well into the 90s and low 100s over Southwest Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable with surface based CAPE values in excess of 4000 J/Kg.  Strong shear  created a favorable environment for supercell development.  Convergence to the east of the surface low sufficiently eroded the cap by late afternoon, leading to explosive development of an isolated supercell near Waterloo.  This supercell produced a tornado in Dunkerton in Black Hawk County, which did extensive damage.  This same tornado weakened as it moved into Buchanan County.  Other weak tornadoes were spawned in Buchanan County.  There were also indications of scattered damage produced by downbursts with the second and fourth tornadoes.  Iowa governor Tom Vilsack signed a proclamation declaring Black Hawk and Buchanan Counties disaster areas.  Damage was estimated at over 1 million dollars.  Most of the damage in Buchanan County came on four farms.  The damage was spread along an eight mile stretch south of Hazelton.  Machine sheds, grain bins and outbuildings were blown apart.

Tornadoes, widespread and localized flash flooding, funnel clouds, damaging hurricane-force, straight-line winds associated with a wicked squall-line, large hail stones, urban/small flooding, lightning strikes, and significant mainstem river flooding were reported.  As in the preceding weeks, a quasi-stationary front over northern Illinois served as a boundary for warm, moist, unstable air to be pulled north over the cooler air over Wisconsin.  Leftover flooding (from the evening of May 31, 2000) and isolated severe thunderstorms were noted during the pre-dawn to mid morning hours.  However a powerful squall-line formed along the Mississippi River in the La Crosse area by mid-afternoon, and pushed into south-central Wisconsin by late afternoon with ""all hell breaking loose.""   After the squall line moved into the southeast part of the state, it was followed by widespread showers and thunderstorms that triggered additional flooding problems. The east/southeast moving storms would not end until around 2300CST.  As a result of the wild weather events, a State of Emergency was declared in Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Green, Iowa, Lafayette, Rock, and Sauk counties.  Numerous power lines were knocked down by felled trees or wind gusts outright, resulting in the lose of power to 20,000 customers.  Significant storm and flooding events will be summarized below county by county.Marquette Co:  6 homes were damaged and trees uprooted by powerful winds estimated at 70 knots (80 mph) in Briggsville. Urban flooding in Briggsville was also noted with water 6 inches deep.Green Lake Co:  powerful winds knocked down trees in both Kingston and Markesan, and large hail was noted.Fond du Lac Co: a brief, F0 tornado spun up in the rural area southeast of Oak Center. Only some hay crop was damaged. Elsewhere, urban flooding and large hail was noted. Between 1700 and 1900CST, 1.71 inches of rain fell in the city of Fond du Lac.Sheboygan Co: powerful thunderstorm winds pushed over trees in the southern portions. Sauk Co: powerful winds blew over large trees in the Reedsburg to Baraboo area as well as around Prairie du Sac.  Then the heavens oped up as 3.75 inches of rain fell between 1600 and 1645CST in North Freedom. There were other reports of up to 6 inches of rain falling in 2 hours.  Flash flooding developed along Narrows Creek which left mud marks 8 feet high on some buildings. So much water came down Narrows Creek that it temporarily backed up the water of the Baraboo River!  The Baraboo River flooded homes, and other creeks tore pieces of Highways 12 and 113 away.  Road beds and parking lots were ripped away on the south side of Baraboo.  Some railroad beds and many drainage culverts across the county were washed away.  Severe erosion was noted on the cliffs overlooking the north shore of Devils Lake, whose water level rose about 3 feet due to runoff.  All together, 153 residential homes were damaged, 17 businesses reported water damage, and 220,000 acres of farm land sustained water or erosion damage.  The flooding was more widespread and worse than the 1993 flood, based on newspaper accounts.  The Baraboo River near Baraboo crested at 22.04 feet on June 2nd, or 6.04 feet above flood stage (moderate flooding), after rising above flood stage at 0400CST on the 1st.  Upriver at Rock Springs, the flood stage of 18.5 feet was exceeded at 1630CST on the 1st, and the crest was 21.71 feet at 0750CST on the 2nd (major flooding).  Columbia Co: powerful winds uprooted large trees in and around Portage.  In addition, a garage was damaged, several vehicles were blown into roadside ditches quickly reached a depth of 1 to 3 feet over portions of Highway 12 around Portage, and on Highway 73 in the southeast corner where residents were evacuated.  Gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were reported on some roads. Agricultural crop damage and soil erosion were also noted.Dodge Co: the main event was a long-lived tornado that spun up just south of Highway S about 4 miles south of Horicon, just southwest of the intersection of Highways S and E.  Eyewitness accounts suggested that this tornado was a rain-wrapped and multi-vortex as it hopped-skipped east/southeast through the heart of the village of Iron Ridge (F2 at this time, 140-50 mph wind), before exiting the county on Highway S.  All together, this F2 tornado destroyed 6 homes, and damaged 26 other homes, 6 businesses, 2 barns, 1 silo, semi-tractor trailer, a green house, and many cars.  It destroyed 5 agricultural buildings. No one was injured or killed by this early-warned tornado.  Five other barns were damaged in the county by the powerful straight-line winds associated with the squall-line.  In addition, large hail up to walnut size was noted.  Flash flooding was reported in the southeast part of the county when 1.5 inches of rain fell in a short period of time.  Soil erosion and shoulder washouts were reported near the intersection of Highways 60 and P, south of Rubicon.Washington Co: the Dodge County tornado continued into Washington County for about 1.5 miles near and along Highway S.  It damaged a barn and silo and uprooted more trees before dissipating.  The tornado in this county had winds estimated at 80 mph, or F1 strength.  No one was injured or killed.  Flash flooding was reported south of Hartford where soil erosion and gravel shoulder washouts occurred due to swirling flood waters.  Otherwise, large hail and tree-uprooting winds were noted in Germantown.Iowa Co: Pre-dawn flash flooding occurred across the northern portion of Iowa County due to leftover thunderstorms that hit the county on May 31st.  Morrey Creek overflowed it banks in the village of Avoca, damaging 35 homes and eroding surrounding landscaping.  In Dodge State Park near Dodgeville, 50 miles of trails were closed after several bridges were washed out by flooding waters.  In addition, gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were noted on several roads.   Another round of flash flooding occurred across the northern portion of the county thanks to torrential rains of 2 to 4 inches in 1 to 2 hours in the late afternoon and early evening hours. An estimated 10,250 acres sustained major soil erosion and many roads had water depths of 1 to 3 feet as water currents washed away gravel shoulders. Crop damage was extensive.  Dane Co: pre-dawn severe storms dumped large hail and knocked down many tree limbs in the Madison area.  During the same storm, lightning struck a west-side Madison hotel, resulting in damage to its electrical system.  Urban/small stream flooding was noted in the pre-dawn hours across the northern part of the county with water covering low spots on Highways 12, 73, and 113.  A couple streets were flooded and closed in the village of Mazomanie due to high water levels on the Black Earth Creek. Sandbagging was needed to protect about a dozen homes in Mazomanie.  Powerful thunderstorm winds uprooted trees which then damaged many vehicles in the Madison to Cottage Grove area during the evening.  At least 60 trees blocked various roads in the Madison area, and 18 power lines were reported down.  Roof tiles were also removed from some homes as the winds gusted to an estimated 70 knots (80 mph).  An expensive gazebo was destroyed by uprooted trees in the city of Monona.  Shortly thereafter, flash-flood producing rains hit much of the county.  Madison streets were rivers as 27 cars were stranded or pushed around.  It was the worst flooding the city during the past 15 years.  Sandbagging commenced in Monona to protect homes.  Many roads across the county were damaged by flood waters, with most damage in the northwest part of the county.   In the village of Oregon, 1.90 inches of rain was measured in just 45 minutes ending at 1830CST.   Additional soil erosion and ponding of water resulted in extensive, severe crop damage across the county.  Collectively, wind and/or flood damage occurred to at least 646 residential homes in the county, and to 3 businesses.  Probably 30,000 acres of farm land had significant crop damage.  A new daily rainfall record of 3.46 inches was set at Madison's Traux Field, breaking the old record of 1.33 inches set back in 1892.  Runoff from this rainfall eventually pushed Lake Mendota to 31.5 inches above its normal summer level on June 5th, which was the highest reading since the beginning of records in 1916.  In response to the high lake levels in Dane county, many nearby homes were sandbagged, and public beach and boat docks were closed.Jefferson Co: an early morning, severe thunderstorm dumped large hail on Lake Mills.  Another storm's lightning struck a Ft. Atkinson church steeple, resulting in structural and water damage. The evening storms generated damaging winds that uprooted large trees.  Lightning started a minor fire on a Lake Mills home's roof.  Heavy rains of 2 to 3 inches during the evening generated scattered flash flooding across the county, mostly in the form of gravel shoulder washouts of several roads.  Roads near the Rock River in Ft. Atkinson were closed due to the swirling waters.  Soil erosion and crop washouts were noted across the county.  Rainfall totals of 2.39 inches and 2.72 inches were noted in Ft. Atkinson and Jefferson, respectively.  The heavy rains forced the Crawfish River at Milford to exceed the flood stage of 7 feet on June 2nd , and crest at 8.38 feet on June 7th (moderate flooding). Waukesha Co: powerful thunderstorm winds uprooted trees in the Genesee area.Milwaukee Co: large hail was reported in the city of Milwaukee.  Torrential rains of around 2 inches in 1 to 2 hours in the city of Fox Point resulted in flash flooding in that city. Landscaping damage and some road damage was noted due to swift water currents.Lafayette Co: a brief tornado occurred north of Calamine. It damaged 2 large pole sheds and uprooted many trees along its short path. Several calves were injured as they were pushed across the road. Eyewitness accounts suggest this F1 tornado (winds about 100 mph) was rain-wrapped.  Otherwise, the squall line's powerful winds uprooted trees and over-turned a car-trailer combo east of Belmont.  Similar to other counties, flash-flood producing rains followed the winds.  Across the county, all mainstem river, stream, creeks, and other low spots experienced flash flooding.  Bridge under-cutting was noted on Highway K outside of Gratiot, on Highway H in Jenkynsville, and Highway G in the northwest corner.  Moderate to severe damage to road shoulders and washed out driveways was noted countywide.  Twenty-one roads were closed at one time or another.  At least 75 residential homes and 5 businesses reported flood damage, while 2 private utility buildings suffered damage.  Two farm buildings were destroyed by the flood waters, and 15 others damaged.  About 7000 acres of farm land were severely damaged.  The Pecatonica River in Darlington closed down Highway 23 from the south. The river at this location exceeded the flood stage of 11 feet late on May 31st, and crested at 15.77 feet at 0730CST on June 1st (moderate flooding).  Near South Wayne, lightning started a minor house fire.Green Co: pre-dawn and morning urban/small stream flooding occurred countywide due to rainfall that started on May 31st.  The rains ended by sunrise.  Up to 5 inches of rain fell overnight in the southwest part of the county.  Many streams were 5 to 10 feet wide, resulting in water covering low-lying roads to a depth of 1 foot.  Several cars were swept into roadside ditches.  Urban basements had minor flood damage.  Additional heavy rains followed the evening squall line which resulted in a new round of flash flooding across much of the county.  Eight miles of the 24 mile long Sugar River State Trail were closed from near Monticello to near Albany due to washed out bridges and undercut paths.  Five homes sustained significant damage.  Numerous roads were closed due to high water levels and dozens of vehicles were stranded or pushed into roadside ditches.  Gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were noted countywide.  Water levels in the city of Brodhead were the highest in many years.  Legion Park in Albany was closed after the adjacent Sugar River exceeded flood stage.  Moderate to severe soil erosion was noted to 5000 acres of farm fields.  The Pecatonica River at Martintown exceeded the flood stage of 13.5 feet at 0000CST on June 1st, and crested at 18.51 feet on June 4th (moderate flooding).Rock Co: powerful thunderstorm winds downed large trees in scattered parts of the county.  However, flash-flood producing rains hit during the evening hours. Most mainstem and nearly all streams and creeks jumped their banks. Nine roads along Lake Koshkonong sustained washout damage due to swift water currents. At least 100 homes outside of the major cities sustained damage.  Many Beloit and Janesville homes in low spots reported landscape flood damage as well as basement flooding. Flash flood waters also tore through farm fields, leaving moderate to severe soil erosion and crop damage to at least 20,000 acres.  Flood waters from the Sugar River in the southwest corner of the county closed roads west of the village of Avon.Walworth Co: no damage reports.Kenosha Co: several rounds of heavy rains during the evening on top of previously saturated soils and high river levels resulted in flash flooding scattered across the county.  Several roads had fast-flowing waters 1 to 3 feet deep which resulted in shoulder washouts and cars being swept into roadside ditches.  At least 75 homes sustained significant flood damage in the Wheatland, Salem, and Silver Lake areas.  About 47,000 acres of farm land had serious soil erosion, and washed or flooded crops.  Due to rainfall totals during the evening of 2 to 3 inches, the Fox River at New Munster continued to rise and would eventually crest at 12.76 feet early on June 3rd, or 2.76 feet above flood stage. Three homes Silver Lake homes were evacuated.",,PDC

The upper air pattern remained very dynamic with a powerful upper level jet stream punching into Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable.  Thunderstorms erupted quite rapidly during the early afternoon hours to the west of Iowa.  They moved into the state during the early afternoon with several reports of tornadoes in the far west.  The storms weakened somewhat before entering the Des Moines CWA.  They took on the form of a line echo wave pattern as they headed across the state.  Portions of the line bowed out and produced high winds in many areas.  Indeed, high winds was the main severe threat with this line as it raced across the state.  There were numerous reports of trees and power lines downed by the high winds.  Gusts to around 80 MPH swept into Cass County as the line moved through.  Fortunately, this gust occurred in largely open area.  The storms caused more structural damage as they headed into the more populated central Iowa counties.  High winds damaged a farmstead in Story County south of Collins.  Another farmstead north of Collins sustained damage to a barn and part of the house.  As the storms progressed east, high winds flattened a barn and broke windows out of a house southwest of State Center in Marshall County.  A tornado dropped out of the storm as it moved across Marshall County as well.  The track was intermittent, but the tornado did cause damage to at least two farmsteads along its path.  Another storm produced a brief tornado touchdown in Tama County.  The tornado did little damage, but did manage to hit and knock over a couple of transformers east of Garwin.  There was little hail reported with the storms, however one inch diameter hail was reported in Grundy County as Dike.  As the thunderstorms moved through the Calhoun County area, lightning struck a gas meter on a house in Farnhamville.

Tornadoes, widespread and localized flash flooding, funnel clouds, damaging hurricane-force, straight-line winds associated with a wicked squall-line, large hail stones, urban/small flooding, lightning strikes, and significant mainstem river flooding were reported.  As in the preceding weeks, a quasi-stationary front over northern Illinois served as a boundary for warm, moist, unstable air to be pulled north over the cooler air over Wisconsin.  Leftover flooding (from the evening of May 31, 2000) and isolated severe thunderstorms were noted during the pre-dawn to mid morning hours.  However a powerful squall-line formed along the Mississippi River in the La Crosse area by mid-afternoon, and pushed into south-central Wisconsin by late afternoon with ""all hell breaking loose.""   After the squall line moved into the southeast part of the state, it was followed by widespread showers and thunderstorms that triggered additional flooding problems. The east/southeast moving storms would not end until around 2300CST.  As a result of the wild weather events, a State of Emergency was declared in Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Green, Iowa, Lafayette, Rock, and Sauk counties.  Numerous power lines were knocked down by felled trees or wind gusts outright, resulting in the lose of power to 20,000 customers.  Significant storm and flooding events will be summarized below county by county.Marquette Co:  6 homes were damaged and trees uprooted by powerful winds estimated at 70 knots (80 mph) in Briggsville. Urban flooding in Briggsville was also noted with water 6 inches deep.Green Lake Co:  powerful winds knocked down trees in both Kingston and Markesan, and large hail was noted.Fond du Lac Co: a brief, F0 tornado spun up in the rural area southeast of Oak Center. Only some hay crop was damaged. Elsewhere, urban flooding and large hail was noted. Between 1700 and 1900CST, 1.71 inches of rain fell in the city of Fond du Lac.Sheboygan Co: powerful thunderstorm winds pushed over trees in the southern portions. Sauk Co: powerful winds blew over large trees in the Reedsburg to Baraboo area as well as around Prairie du Sac.  Then the heavens oped up as 3.75 inches of rain fell between 1600 and 1645CST in North Freedom. There were other reports of up to 6 inches of rain falling in 2 hours.  Flash flooding developed along Narrows Creek which left mud marks 8 feet high on some buildings. So much water came down Narrows Creek that it temporarily backed up the water of the Baraboo River!  The Baraboo River flooded homes, and other creeks tore pieces of Highways 12 and 113 away.  Road beds and parking lots were ripped away on the south side of Baraboo.  Some railroad beds and many drainage culverts across the county were washed away.  Severe erosion was noted on the cliffs overlooking the north shore of Devils Lake, whose water level rose about 3 feet due to runoff.  All together, 153 residential homes were damaged, 17 businesses reported water damage, and 220,000 acres of farm land sustained water or erosion damage.  The flooding was more widespread and worse than the 1993 flood, based on newspaper accounts.  The Baraboo River near Baraboo crested at 22.04 feet on June 2nd, or 6.04 feet above flood stage (moderate flooding), after rising above flood stage at 0400CST on the 1st.  Upriver at Rock Springs, the flood stage of 18.5 feet was exceeded at 1630CST on the 1st, and the crest was 21.71 feet at 0750CST on the 2nd (major flooding).  Columbia Co: powerful winds uprooted large trees in and around Portage.  In addition, a garage was damaged, several vehicles were blown into roadside ditches quickly reached a depth of 1 to 3 feet over portions of Highway 12 around Portage, and on Highway 73 in the southeast corner where residents were evacuated.  Gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were reported on some roads. Agricultural crop damage and soil erosion were also noted.Dodge Co: the main event was a long-lived tornado that spun up just south of Highway S about 4 miles south of Horicon, just southwest of the intersection of Highways S and E.  Eyewitness accounts suggested that this tornado was a rain-wrapped and multi-vortex as it hopped-skipped east/southeast through the heart of the village of Iron Ridge (F2 at this time, 140-50 mph wind), before exiting the county on Highway S.  All together, this F2 tornado destroyed 6 homes, and damaged 26 other homes, 6 businesses, 2 barns, 1 silo, semi-tractor trailer, a green house, and many cars.  It destroyed 5 agricultural buildings. No one was injured or killed by this early-warned tornado.  Five other barns were damaged in the county by the powerful straight-line winds associated with the squall-line.  In addition, large hail up to walnut size was noted.  Flash flooding was reported in the southeast part of the county when 1.5 inches of rain fell in a short period of time.  Soil erosion and shoulder washouts were reported near the intersection of Highways 60 and P, south of Rubicon.Washington Co: the Dodge County tornado continued into Washington County for about 1.5 miles near and along Highway S.  It damaged a barn and silo and uprooted more trees before dissipating.  The tornado in this county had winds estimated at 80 mph, or F1 strength.  No one was injured or killed.  Flash flooding was reported south of Hartford where soil erosion and gravel shoulder washouts occurred due to swirling flood waters.  Otherwise, large hail and tree-uprooting winds were noted in Germantown.Iowa Co: Pre-dawn flash flooding occurred across the northern portion of Iowa County due to leftover thunderstorms that hit the county on May 31st.  Morrey Creek overflowed it banks in the village of Avoca, damaging 35 homes and eroding surrounding landscaping.  In Dodge State Park near Dodgeville, 50 miles of trails were closed after several bridges were washed out by flooding waters.  In addition, gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were noted on several roads.   Another round of flash flooding occurred across the northern portion of the county thanks to torrential rains of 2 to 4 inches in 1 to 2 hours in the late afternoon and early evening hours. An estimated 10,250 acres sustained major soil erosion and many roads had water depths of 1 to 3 feet as water currents washed away gravel shoulders. Crop damage was extensive.  Dane Co: pre-dawn severe storms dumped large hail and knocked down many tree limbs in the Madison area.  During the same storm, lightning struck a west-side Madison hotel, resulting in damage to its electrical system.  Urban/small stream flooding was noted in the pre-dawn hours across the northern part of the county with water covering low spots on Highways 12, 73, and 113.  A couple streets were flooded and closed in the village of Mazomanie due to high water levels on the Black Earth Creek. Sandbagging was needed to protect about a dozen homes in Mazomanie.  Powerful thunderstorm winds uprooted trees which then damaged many vehicles in the Madison to Cottage Grove area during the evening.  At least 60 trees blocked various roads in the Madison area, and 18 power lines were reported down.  Roof tiles were also removed from some homes as the winds gusted to an estimated 70 knots (80 mph).  An expensive gazebo was destroyed by uprooted trees in the city of Monona.  Shortly thereafter, flash-flood producing rains hit much of the county.  Madison streets were rivers as 27 cars were stranded or pushed around.  It was the worst flooding the city during the past 15 years.  Sandbagging commenced in Monona to protect homes.  Many roads across the county were damaged by flood waters, with most damage in the northwest part of the county.   In the village of Oregon, 1.90 inches of rain was measured in just 45 minutes ending at 1830CST.   Additional soil erosion and ponding of water resulted in extensive, severe crop damage across the county.  Collectively, wind and/or flood damage occurred to at least 646 residential homes in the county, and to 3 businesses.  Probably 30,000 acres of farm land had significant crop damage.  A new daily rainfall record of 3.46 inches was set at Madison's Traux Field, breaking the old record of 1.33 inches set back in 1892.  Runoff from this rainfall eventually pushed Lake Mendota to 31.5 inches above its normal summer level on June 5th, which was the highest reading since the beginning of records in 1916.  In response to the high lake levels in Dane county, many nearby homes were sandbagged, and public beach and boat docks were closed.Jefferson Co: an early morning, severe thunderstorm dumped large hail on Lake Mills.  Another storm's lightning struck a Ft. Atkinson church steeple, resulting in structural and water damage. The evening storms generated damaging winds that uprooted large trees.  Lightning started a minor fire on a Lake Mills home's roof.  Heavy rains of 2 to 3 inches during the evening generated scattered flash flooding across the county, mostly in the form of gravel shoulder washouts of several roads.  Roads near the Rock River in Ft. Atkinson were closed due to the swirling waters.  Soil erosion and crop washouts were noted across the county.  Rainfall totals of 2.39 inches and 2.72 inches were noted in Ft. Atkinson and Jefferson, respectively.  The heavy rains forced the Crawfish River at Milford to exceed the flood stage of 7 feet on June 2nd , and crest at 8.38 feet on June 7th (moderate flooding). Waukesha Co: powerful thunderstorm winds uprooted trees in the Genesee area.Milwaukee Co: large hail was reported in the city of Milwaukee.  Torrential rains of around 2 inches in 1 to 2 hours in the city of Fox Point resulted in flash flooding in that city. Landscaping damage and some road damage was noted due to swift water currents.Lafayette Co: a brief tornado occurred north of Calamine. It damaged 2 large pole sheds and uprooted many trees along its short path. Several calves were injured as they were pushed across the road. Eyewitness accounts suggest this F1 tornado (winds about 100 mph) was rain-wrapped.  Otherwise, the squall line's powerful winds uprooted trees and over-turned a car-trailer combo east of Belmont.  Similar to other counties, flash-flood producing rains followed the winds.  Across the county, all mainstem river, stream, creeks, and other low spots experienced flash flooding.  Bridge under-cutting was noted on Highway K outside of Gratiot, on Highway H in Jenkynsville, and Highway G in the northwest corner.  Moderate to severe damage to road shoulders and washed out driveways was noted countywide.  Twenty-one roads were closed at one time or another.  At least 75 residential homes and 5 businesses reported flood damage, while 2 private utility buildings suffered damage.  Two farm buildings were destroyed by the flood waters, and 15 others damaged.  About 7000 acres of farm land were severely damaged.  The Pecatonica River in Darlington closed down Highway 23 from the south. The river at this location exceeded the flood stage of 11 feet late on May 31st, and crested at 15.77 feet at 0730CST on June 1st (moderate flooding).  Near South Wayne, lightning started a minor house fire.Green Co: pre-dawn and morning urban/small stream flooding occurred countywide due to rainfall that started on May 31st.  The rains ended by sunrise.  Up to 5 inches of rain fell overnight in the southwest part of the county.  Many streams were 5 to 10 feet wide, resulting in water covering low-lying roads to a depth of 1 foot.  Several cars were swept into roadside ditches.  Urban basements had minor flood damage.  Additional heavy rains followed the evening squall line which resulted in a new round of flash flooding across much of the county.  Eight miles of the 24 mile long Sugar River State Trail were closed from near Monticello to near Albany due to washed out bridges and undercut paths.  Five homes sustained significant damage.  Numerous roads were closed due to high water levels and dozens of vehicles were stranded or pushed into roadside ditches.  Gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were noted countywide.  Water levels in the city of Brodhead were the highest in many years.  Legion Park in Albany was closed after the adjacent Sugar River exceeded flood stage.  Moderate to severe soil erosion was noted to 5000 acres of farm fields.  The Pecatonica River at Martintown exceeded the flood stage of 13.5 feet at 0000CST on June 1st, and crested at 18.51 feet on June 4th (moderate flooding).Rock Co: powerful thunderstorm winds downed large trees in scattered parts of the county.  However, flash-flood producing rains hit during the evening hours. Most mainstem and nearly all streams and creeks jumped their banks. Nine roads along Lake Koshkonong sustained washout damage due to swift water currents. At least 100 homes outside of the major cities sustained damage.  Many Beloit and Janesville homes in low spots reported landscape flood damage as well as basement flooding. Flash flood waters also tore through farm fields, leaving moderate to severe soil erosion and crop damage to at least 20,000 acres.  Flood waters from the Sugar River in the southwest corner of the county closed roads west of the village of Avon.Walworth Co: no damage reports.Kenosha Co: several rounds of heavy rains during the evening on top of previously saturated soils and high river levels resulted in flash flooding scattered across the county.  Several roads had fast-flowing waters 1 to 3 feet deep which resulted in shoulder washouts and cars being swept into roadside ditches.  At least 75 homes sustained significant flood damage in the Wheatland, Salem, and Silver Lake areas.  About 47,000 acres of farm land had serious soil erosion, and washed or flooded crops.  Due to rainfall totals during the evening of 2 to 3 inches, the Fox River at New Munster continued to rise and would eventually crest at 12.76 feet early on June 3rd, or 2.76 feet above flood stage. Three homes Silver Lake homes were evacuated.",,PDC

Tornadoes, widespread and localized flash flooding, funnel clouds, damaging hurricane-force, straight-line winds associated with a wicked squall-line, large hail stones, urban/small flooding, lightning strikes, and significant mainstem river flooding were reported.  As in the preceding weeks, a quasi-stationary front over northern Illinois served as a boundary for warm, moist, unstable air to be pulled north over the cooler air over Wisconsin.  Leftover flooding (from the evening of May 31, 2000) and isolated severe thunderstorms were noted during the pre-dawn to mid morning hours.  However a powerful squall-line formed along the Mississippi River in the La Crosse area by mid-afternoon, and pushed into south-central Wisconsin by late afternoon with ""all hell breaking loose.""   After the squall line moved into the southeast part of the state, it was followed by widespread showers and thunderstorms that triggered additional flooding problems. The east/southeast moving storms would not end until around 2300CST.  As a result of the wild weather events, a State of Emergency was declared in Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Green, Iowa, Lafayette, Rock, and Sauk counties.  Numerous power lines were knocked down by felled trees or wind gusts outright, resulting in the lose of power to 20,000 customers.  Significant storm and flooding events will be summarized below county by county.Marquette Co:  6 homes were damaged and trees uprooted by powerful winds estimated at 70 knots (80 mph) in Briggsville. Urban flooding in Briggsville was also noted with water 6 inches deep.Green Lake Co:  powerful winds knocked down trees in both Kingston and Markesan, and large hail was noted.Fond du Lac Co: a brief, F0 tornado spun up in the rural area southeast of Oak Center. Only some hay crop was damaged. Elsewhere, urban flooding and large hail was noted. Between 1700 and 1900CST, 1.71 inches of rain fell in the city of Fond du Lac.Sheboygan Co: powerful thunderstorm winds pushed over trees in the southern portions. Sauk Co: powerful winds blew over large trees in the Reedsburg to Baraboo area as well as around Prairie du Sac.  Then the heavens oped up as 3.75 inches of rain fell between 1600 and 1645CST in North Freedom. There were other reports of up to 6 inches of rain falling in 2 hours.  Flash flooding developed along Narrows Creek which left mud marks 8 feet high on some buildings. So much water came down Narrows Creek that it temporarily backed up the water of the Baraboo River!  The Baraboo River flooded homes, and other creeks tore pieces of Highways 12 and 113 away.  Road beds and parking lots were ripped away on the south side of Baraboo.  Some railroad beds and many drainage culverts across the county were washed away.  Severe erosion was noted on the cliffs overlooking the north shore of Devils Lake, whose water level rose about 3 feet due to runoff.  All together, 153 residential homes were damaged, 17 businesses reported water damage, and 220,000 acres of farm land sustained water or erosion damage.  The flooding was more widespread and worse than the 1993 flood, based on newspaper accounts.  The Baraboo River near Baraboo crested at 22.04 feet on June 2nd, or 6.04 feet above flood stage (moderate flooding), after rising above flood stage at 0400CST on the 1st.  Upriver at Rock Springs, the flood stage of 18.5 feet was exceeded at 1630CST on the 1st, and the crest was 21.71 feet at 0750CST on the 2nd (major flooding).  Columbia Co: powerful winds uprooted large trees in and around Portage.  In addition, a garage was damaged, several vehicles were blown into roadside ditches quickly reached a depth of 1 to 3 feet over portions of Highway 12 around Portage, and on Highway 73 in the southeast corner where residents were evacuated.  Gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were reported on some roads. Agricultural crop damage and soil erosion were also noted.Dodge Co: the main event was a long-lived tornado that spun up just south of Highway S about 4 miles south of Horicon, just southwest of the intersection of Highways S and E.  Eyewitness accounts suggested that this tornado was a rain-wrapped and multi-vortex as it hopped-skipped east/southeast through the heart of the village of Iron Ridge (F2 at this time, 140-50 mph wind), before exiting the county on Highway S.  All together, this F2 tornado destroyed 6 homes, and damaged 26 other homes, 6 businesses, 2 barns, 1 silo, semi-tractor trailer, a green house, and many cars.  It destroyed 5 agricultural buildings. No one was injured or killed by this early-warned tornado.  Five other barns were damaged in the county by the powerful straight-line winds associated with the squall-line.  In addition, large hail up to walnut size was noted.  Flash flooding was reported in the southeast part of the county when 1.5 inches of rain fell in a short period of time.  Soil erosion and shoulder washouts were reported near the intersection of Highways 60 and P, south of Rubicon.Washington Co: the Dodge County tornado continued into Washington County for about 1.5 miles near and along Highway S.  It damaged a barn and silo and uprooted more trees before dissipating.  The tornado in this county had winds estimated at 80 mph, or F1 strength.  No one was injured or killed.  Flash flooding was reported south of Hartford where soil erosion and gravel shoulder washouts occurred due to swirling flood waters.  Otherwise, large hail and tree-uprooting winds were noted in Germantown.Iowa Co: Pre-dawn flash flooding occurred across the northern portion of Iowa County due to leftover thunderstorms that hit the county on May 31st.  Morrey Creek overflowed it banks in the village of Avoca, damaging 35 homes and eroding surrounding landscaping.  In Dodge State Park near Dodgeville, 50 miles of trails were closed after several bridges were washed out by flooding waters.  In addition, gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were noted on several roads.   Another round of flash flooding occurred across the northern portion of the county thanks to torrential rains of 2 to 4 inches in 1 to 2 hours in the late afternoon and early evening hours. An estimated 10,250 acres sustained major soil erosion and many roads had water depths of 1 to 3 feet as water currents washed away gravel shoulders. Crop damage was extensive.  Dane Co: pre-dawn severe storms dumped large hail and knocked down many tree limbs in the Madison area.  During the same storm, lightning struck a west-side Madison hotel, resulting in damage to its electrical system.  Urban/small stream flooding was noted in the pre-dawn hours across the northern part of the county with water covering low spots on Highways 12, 73, and 113.  A couple streets were flooded and closed in the village of Mazomanie due to high water levels on the Black Earth Creek. Sandbagging was needed to protect about a dozen homes in Mazomanie.  Powerful thunderstorm winds uprooted trees which then damaged many vehicles in the Madison to Cottage Grove area during the evening.  At least 60 trees blocked various roads in the Madison area, and 18 power lines were reported down.  Roof tiles were also removed from some homes as the winds gusted to an estimated 70 knots (80 mph).  An expensive gazebo was destroyed by uprooted trees in the city of Monona.  Shortly thereafter, flash-flood producing rains hit much of the county.  Madison streets were rivers as 27 cars were stranded or pushed around.  It was the worst flooding the city during the past 15 years.  Sandbagging commenced in Monona to protect homes.  Many roads across the county were damaged by flood waters, with most damage in the northwest part of the county.   In the village of Oregon, 1.90 inches of rain was measured in just 45 minutes ending at 1830CST.   Additional soil erosion and ponding of water resulted in extensive, severe crop damage across the county.  Collectively, wind and/or flood damage occurred to at least 646 residential homes in the county, and to 3 businesses.  Probably 30,000 acres of farm land had significant crop damage.  A new daily rainfall record of 3.46 inches was set at Madison's Traux Field, breaking the old record of 1.33 inches set back in 1892.  Runoff from this rainfall eventually pushed Lake Mendota to 31.5 inches above its normal summer level on June 5th, which was the highest reading since the beginning of records in 1916.  In response to the high lake levels in Dane county, many nearby homes were sandbagged, and public beach and boat docks were closed.Jefferson Co: an early morning, severe thunderstorm dumped large hail on Lake Mills.  Another storm's lightning struck a Ft. Atkinson church steeple, resulting in structural and water damage. The evening storms generated damaging winds that uprooted large trees.  Lightning started a minor fire on a Lake Mills home's roof.  Heavy rains of 2 to 3 inches during the evening generated scattered flash flooding across the county, mostly in the form of gravel shoulder washouts of several roads.  Roads near the Rock River in Ft. Atkinson were closed due to the swirling waters.  Soil erosion and crop washouts were noted across the county.  Rainfall totals of 2.39 inches and 2.72 inches were noted in Ft. Atkinson and Jefferson, respectively.  The heavy rains forced the Crawfish River at Milford to exceed the flood stage of 7 feet on June 2nd , and crest at 8.38 feet on June 7th (moderate flooding). Waukesha Co: powerful thunderstorm winds uprooted trees in the Genesee area.Milwaukee Co: large hail was reported in the city of Milwaukee.  Torrential rains of around 2 inches in 1 to 2 hours in the city of Fox Point resulted in flash flooding in that city. Landscaping damage and some road damage was noted due to swift water currents.Lafayette Co: a brief tornado occurred north of Calamine. It damaged 2 large pole sheds and uprooted many trees along its short path. Several calves were injured as they were pushed across the road. Eyewitness accounts suggest this F1 tornado (winds about 100 mph) was rain-wrapped.  Otherwise, the squall line's powerful winds uprooted trees and over-turned a car-trailer combo east of Belmont.  Similar to other counties, flash-flood producing rains followed the winds.  Across the county, all mainstem river, stream, creeks, and other low spots experienced flash flooding.  Bridge under-cutting was noted on Highway K outside of Gratiot, on Highway H in Jenkynsville, and Highway G in the northwest corner.  Moderate to severe damage to road shoulders and washed out driveways was noted countywide.  Twenty-one roads were closed at one time or another.  At least 75 residential homes and 5 businesses reported flood damage, while 2 private utility buildings suffered damage.  Two farm buildings were destroyed by the flood waters, and 15 others damaged.  About 7000 acres of farm land were severely damaged.  The Pecatonica River in Darlington closed down Highway 23 from the south. The river at this location exceeded the flood stage of 11 feet late on May 31st, and crested at 15.77 feet at 0730CST on June 1st (moderate flooding).  Near South Wayne, lightning started a minor house fire.Green Co: pre-dawn and morning urban/small stream flooding occurred countywide due to rainfall that started on May 31st.  The rains ended by sunrise.  Up to 5 inches of rain fell overnight in the southwest part of the county.  Many streams were 5 to 10 feet wide, resulting in water covering low-lying roads to a depth of 1 foot.  Several cars were swept into roadside ditches.  Urban basements had minor flood damage.  Additional heavy rains followed the evening squall line which resulted in a new round of flash flooding across much of the county.  Eight miles of the 24 mile long Sugar River State Trail were closed from near Monticello to near Albany due to washed out bridges and undercut paths.  Five homes sustained significant damage.  Numerous roads were closed due to high water levels and dozens of vehicles were stranded or pushed into roadside ditches.  Gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were noted countywide.  Water levels in the city of Brodhead were the highest in many years.  Legion Park in Albany was closed after the adjacent Sugar River exceeded flood stage.  Moderate to severe soil erosion was noted to 5000 acres of farm fields.  The Pecatonica River at Martintown exceeded the flood stage of 13.5 feet at 0000CST on June 1st, and crested at 18.51 feet on June 4th (moderate flooding).Rock Co: powerful thunderstorm winds downed large trees in scattered parts of the county.  However, flash-flood producing rains hit during the evening hours. Most mainstem and nearly all streams and creeks jumped their banks. Nine roads along Lake Koshkonong sustained washout damage due to swift water currents. At least 100 homes outside of the major cities sustained damage.  Many Beloit and Janesville homes in low spots reported landscape flood damage as well as basement flooding. Flash flood waters also tore through farm fields, leaving moderate to severe soil erosion and crop damage to at least 20,000 acres.  Flood waters from the Sugar River in the southwest corner of the county closed roads west of the village of Avon.Walworth Co: no damage reports.Kenosha Co: several rounds of heavy rains during the evening on top of previously saturated soils and high river levels resulted in flash flooding scattered across the county.  Several roads had fast-flowing waters 1 to 3 feet deep which resulted in shoulder washouts and cars being swept into roadside ditches.  At least 75 homes sustained significant flood damage in the Wheatland, Salem, and Silver Lake areas.  About 47,000 acres of farm land had serious soil erosion, and washed or flooded crops.  Due to rainfall totals during the evening of 2 to 3 inches, the Fox River at New Munster continued to rise and would eventually crest at 12.76 feet early on June 3rd, or 2.76 feet above flood stage. Three homes Silver Lake homes were evacuated.",,PDC

Tornadoes, widespread and localized flash flooding, funnel clouds, damaging hurricane-force, straight-line winds associated with a wicked squall-line, large hail stones, urban/small flooding, lightning strikes, and significant mainstem river flooding were reported.  As in the preceding weeks, a quasi-stationary front over northern Illinois served as a boundary for warm, moist, unstable air to be pulled north over the cooler air over Wisconsin.  Leftover flooding (from the evening of May 31, 2000) and isolated severe thunderstorms were noted during the pre-dawn to mid morning hours.  However a powerful squall-line formed along the Mississippi River in the La Crosse area by mid-afternoon, and pushed into south-central Wisconsin by late afternoon with ""all hell breaking loose.""   After the squall line moved into the southeast part of the state, it was followed by widespread showers and thunderstorms that triggered additional flooding problems. The east/southeast moving storms would not end until around 2300CST.  As a result of the wild weather events, a State of Emergency was declared in Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Green, Iowa, Lafayette, Rock, and Sauk counties.  Numerous power lines were knocked down by felled trees or wind gusts outright, resulting in the lose of power to 20,000 customers.  Significant storm and flooding events will be summarized below county by county.Marquette Co:  6 homes were damaged and trees uprooted by powerful winds estimated at 70 knots (80 mph) in Briggsville. Urban flooding in Briggsville was also noted with water 6 inches deep.Green Lake Co:  powerful winds knocked down trees in both Kingston and Markesan, and large hail was noted.Fond du Lac Co: a brief, F0 tornado spun up in the rural area southeast of Oak Center. Only some hay crop was damaged. Elsewhere, urban flooding and large hail was noted. Between 1700 and 1900CST, 1.71 inches of rain fell in the city of Fond du Lac.Sheboygan Co: powerful thunderstorm winds pushed over trees in the southern portions. Sauk Co: powerful winds blew over large trees in the Reedsburg to Baraboo area as well as around Prairie du Sac.  Then the heavens oped up as 3.75 inches of rain fell between 1600 and 1645CST in North Freedom. There were other reports of up to 6 inches of rain falling in 2 hours.  Flash flooding developed along Narrows Creek which left mud marks 8 feet high on some buildings. So much water came down Narrows Creek that it temporarily backed up the water of the Baraboo River!  The Baraboo River flooded homes, and other creeks tore pieces of Highways 12 and 113 away.  Road beds and parking lots were ripped away on the south side of Baraboo.  Some railroad beds and many drainage culverts across the county were washed away.  Severe erosion was noted on the cliffs overlooking the north shore of Devils Lake, whose water level rose about 3 feet due to runoff.  All together, 153 residential homes were damaged, 17 businesses reported water damage, and 220,000 acres of farm land sustained water or erosion damage.  The flooding was more widespread and worse than the 1993 flood, based on newspaper accounts.  The Baraboo River near Baraboo crested at 22.04 feet on June 2nd, or 6.04 feet above flood stage (moderate flooding), after rising above flood stage at 0400CST on the 1st.  Upriver at Rock Springs, the flood stage of 18.5 feet was exceeded at 1630CST on the 1st, and the crest was 21.71 feet at 0750CST on the 2nd (major flooding).  Columbia Co: powerful winds uprooted large trees in and around Portage.  In addition, a garage was damaged, several vehicles were blown into roadside ditches quickly reached a depth of 1 to 3 feet over portions of Highway 12 around Portage, and on Highway 73 in the southeast corner where residents were evacuated.  Gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were reported on some roads. Agricultural crop damage and soil erosion were also noted.Dodge Co: the main event was a long-lived tornado that spun up just south of Highway S about 4 miles south of Horicon, just southwest of the intersection of Highways S and E.  Eyewitness accounts suggested that this tornado was a rain-wrapped and multi-vortex as it hopped-skipped east/southeast through the heart of the village of Iron Ridge (F2 at this time, 140-50 mph wind), before exiting the county on Highway S.  All together, this F2 tornado destroyed 6 homes, and damaged 26 other homes, 6 businesses, 2 barns, 1 silo, semi-tractor trailer, a green house, and many cars.  It destroyed 5 agricultural buildings. No one was injured or killed by this early-warned tornado.  Five other barns were damaged in the county by the powerful straight-line winds associated with the squall-line.  In addition, large hail up to walnut size was noted.  Flash flooding was reported in the southeast part of the county when 1.5 inches of rain fell in a short period of time.  Soil erosion and shoulder washouts were reported near the intersection of Highways 60 and P, south of Rubicon.Washington Co: the Dodge County tornado continued into Washington County for about 1.5 miles near and along Highway S.  It damaged a barn and silo and uprooted more trees before dissipating.  The tornado in this county had winds estimated at 80 mph, or F1 strength.  No one was injured or killed.  Flash flooding was reported south of Hartford where soil erosion and gravel shoulder washouts occurred due to swirling flood waters.  Otherwise, large hail and tree-uprooting winds were noted in Germantown.Iowa Co: Pre-dawn flash flooding occurred across the northern portion of Iowa County due to leftover thunderstorms that hit the county on May 31st.  Morrey Creek overflowed it banks in the village of Avoca, damaging 35 homes and eroding surrounding landscaping.  In Dodge State Park near Dodgeville, 50 miles of trails were closed after several bridges were washed out by flooding waters.  In addition, gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were noted on several roads.   Another round of flash flooding occurred across the northern portion of the county thanks to torrential rains of 2 to 4 inches in 1 to 2 hours in the late afternoon and early evening hours. An estimated 10,250 acres sustained major soil erosion and many roads had water depths of 1 to 3 feet as water currents washed away gravel shoulders. Crop damage was extensive.  Dane Co: pre-dawn severe storms dumped large hail and knocked down many tree limbs in the Madison area.  During the same storm, lightning struck a west-side Madison hotel, resulting in damage to its electrical system.  Urban/small stream flooding was noted in the pre-dawn hours across the northern part of the county with water covering low spots on Highways 12, 73, and 113.  A couple streets were flooded and closed in the village of Mazomanie due to high water levels on the Black Earth Creek. Sandbagging was needed to protect about a dozen homes in Mazomanie.  Powerful thunderstorm winds uprooted trees which then damaged many vehicles in the Madison to Cottage Grove area during the evening.  At least 60 trees blocked various roads in the Madison area, and 18 power lines were reported down.  Roof tiles were also removed from some homes as the winds gusted to an estimated 70 knots (80 mph).  An expensive gazebo was destroyed by uprooted trees in the city of Monona.  Shortly thereafter, flash-flood producing rains hit much of the county.  Madison streets were rivers as 27 cars were stranded or pushed around.  It was the worst flooding the city during the past 15 years.  Sandbagging commenced in Monona to protect homes.  Many roads across the county were damaged by flood waters, with most damage in the northwest part of the county.   In the village of Oregon, 1.90 inches of rain was measured in just 45 minutes ending at 1830CST.   Additional soil erosion and ponding of water resulted in extensive, severe crop damage across the county.  Collectively, wind and/or flood damage occurred to at least 646 residential homes in the county, and to 3 businesses.  Probably 30,000 acres of farm land had significant crop damage.  A new daily rainfall record of 3.46 inches was set at Madison's Traux Field, breaking the old record of 1.33 inches set back in 1892.  Runoff from this rainfall eventually pushed Lake Mendota to 31.5 inches above its normal summer level on June 5th, which was the highest reading since the beginning of records in 1916.  In response to the high lake levels in Dane county, many nearby homes were sandbagged, and public beach and boat docks were closed.Jefferson Co: an early morning, severe thunderstorm dumped large hail on Lake Mills.  Another storm's lightning struck a Ft. Atkinson church steeple, resulting in structural and water damage. The evening storms generated damaging winds that uprooted large trees.  Lightning started a minor fire on a Lake Mills home's roof.  Heavy rains of 2 to 3 inches during the evening generated scattered flash flooding across the county, mostly in the form of gravel shoulder washouts of several roads.  Roads near the Rock River in Ft. Atkinson were closed due to the swirling waters.  Soil erosion and crop washouts were noted across the county.  Rainfall totals of 2.39 inches and 2.72 inches were noted in Ft. Atkinson and Jefferson, respectively.  The heavy rains forced the Crawfish River at Milford to exceed the flood stage of 7 feet on June 2nd , and crest at 8.38 feet on June 7th (moderate flooding). Waukesha Co: powerful thunderstorm winds uprooted trees in the Genesee area.Milwaukee Co: large hail was reported in the city of Milwaukee.  Torrential rains of around 2 inches in 1 to 2 hours in the city of Fox Point resulted in flash flooding in that city. Landscaping damage and some road damage was noted due to swift water currents.Lafayette Co: a brief tornado occurred north of Calamine. It damaged 2 large pole sheds and uprooted many trees along its short path. Several calves were injured as they were pushed across the road. Eyewitness accounts suggest this F1 tornado (winds about 100 mph) was rain-wrapped.  Otherwise, the squall line's powerful winds uprooted trees and over-turned a car-trailer combo east of Belmont.  Similar to other counties, flash-flood producing rains followed the winds.  Across the county, all mainstem river, stream, creeks, and other low spots experienced flash flooding.  Bridge under-cutting was noted on Highway K outside of Gratiot, on Highway H in Jenkynsville, and Highway G in the northwest corner.  Moderate to severe damage to road shoulders and washed out driveways was noted countywide.  Twenty-one roads were closed at one time or another.  At least 75 residential homes and 5 businesses reported flood damage, while 2 private utility buildings suffered damage.  Two farm buildings were destroyed by the flood waters, and 15 others damaged.  About 7000 acres of farm land were severely damaged.  The Pecatonica River in Darlington closed down Highway 23 from the south. The river at this location exceeded the flood stage of 11 feet late on May 31st, and crested at 15.77 feet at 0730CST on June 1st (moderate flooding).  Near South Wayne, lightning started a minor house fire.Green Co: pre-dawn and morning urban/small stream flooding occurred countywide due to rainfall that started on May 31st.  The rains ended by sunrise.  Up to 5 inches of rain fell overnight in the southwest part of the county.  Many streams were 5 to 10 feet wide, resulting in water covering low-lying roads to a depth of 1 foot.  Several cars were swept into roadside ditches.  Urban basements had minor flood damage.  Additional heavy rains followed the evening squall line which resulted in a new round of flash flooding across much of the county.  Eight miles of the 24 mile long Sugar River State Trail were closed from near Monticello to near Albany due to washed out bridges and undercut paths.  Five homes sustained significant damage.  Numerous roads were closed due to high water levels and dozens of vehicles were stranded or pushed into roadside ditches.  Gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were noted countywide.  Water levels in the city of Brodhead were the highest in many years.  Legion Park in Albany was closed after the adjacent Sugar River exceeded flood stage.  Moderate to severe soil erosion was noted to 5000 acres of farm fields.  The Pecatonica River at Martintown exceeded the flood stage of 13.5 feet at 0000CST on June 1st, and crested at 18.51 feet on June 4th (moderate flooding).Rock Co: powerful thunderstorm winds downed large trees in scattered parts of the county.  However, flash-flood producing rains hit during the evening hours. Most mainstem and nearly all streams and creeks jumped their banks. Nine roads along Lake Koshkonong sustained washout damage due to swift water currents. At least 100 homes outside of the major cities sustained damage.  Many Beloit and Janesville homes in low spots reported landscape flood damage as well as basement flooding. Flash flood waters also tore through farm fields, leaving moderate to severe soil erosion and crop damage to at least 20,000 acres.  Flood waters from the Sugar River in the southwest corner of the county closed roads west of the village of Avon.Walworth Co: no damage reports.Kenosha Co: several rounds of heavy rains during the evening on top of previously saturated soils and high river levels resulted in flash flooding scattered across the county.  Several roads had fast-flowing waters 1 to 3 feet deep which resulted in shoulder washouts and cars being swept into roadside ditches.  At least 75 homes sustained significant flood damage in the Wheatland, Salem, and Silver Lake areas.  About 47,000 acres of farm land had serious soil erosion, and washed or flooded crops.  Due to rainfall totals during the evening of 2 to 3 inches, the Fox River at New Munster continued to rise and would eventually crest at 12.76 feet early on June 3rd, or 2.76 feet above flood stage. Three homes Silver Lake homes were evacuated.",,PDC

The conclusions were that the damage, which occurred around 630 pm June 2nd, was tornadic and rated as 0 on the Fujita scale (F-0). This rating estimates the wind speed between 40 and 72 mph.The survey began near Essex Street where damage appeared to be straight line, with several trees laying in the same direction. One tree fell through a parked car. Although the damage did not show a tornadic pattern, it was curious how isolated the damage was. Witnesses at the scene claimed there was a lull in the storm, then a sudden whistling and then the sound of a ""freight train."" One man claimed to see rapid rotation within the rain as the trees were lifted and pushed over. Further damage was witnessed a few tenths of a mile to the east on Scarborough Circle. Several trees were knocked down toward the east-southeast. One tree downed caused considerable damage to a porch/deck. Again the consensus was the wind was straight line, albeit curiously isolated.Minor damage also occurred along East Lake Shore Drive. Shingles were torn off one house and a few shallow rooted trees were toppled in convergent directions. A fence to a tennis court across the street was bent over. A witness from this scene claimed to have seen ""a cloud touch down and begin to move across the lake"", right in line with the main damage path.Further to the east-southeast, more damage was discovered. Four or five trees were twisted mid to low trunk and sheared off. The trunks were estimated at 8-10 inches. Witnesses in a nearby house claimed the storm seemed to have stopped, and then  the rain and strong, damaging wind wrapped back in. Behind this damage to the west-northwest was an ascending field leading up to a ridge top. This area comprises an unfinished golf course. Further investigation led to far more tree and vegetative damage. It was noted along the hill that damage increased in coverage further up, lending credence to the theory of a funnel aloft with the ridge rising up to meet the rotation. Numerous large trees were uprooted and fell in convergent patterns, and there were also trees twisted and sheared off from their lower to middle trunks.   At the top of the ridge, a home was discovered with 18 large diameter trees (8-10"") uprooted, sheared off, or twisted along the mid-high trunks. Some of the uprooted trees appeared to be in a convergent pattern. A gentleman interviewed was not home at the time of the storm. A couple trees narrowly missed a direct hit on his home, but crushed a corner of the residence's back deck.Based upon the previously described eyewitness accounts, and the twisting / convergent damage pattern of many trees, the storm was determined to be a weak tornado. Track information from a global geo-positioning unit clearly exhibited a west-northwest to east-southeast oriented path of about 1 mile in length. The tornado was up to 200 yards wide near the ridge top with smaller damage swaths in downhill locations. The tornado was likely aloft for much of the storm, with ground interaction most numerous where the ridge rose up to meet it.",PDC

Enough rain fell to cover a section of Interstate 80 to a depth of two to three feet with water in Adair County, forcing the closure of the Interstate for a period of time.   Water was also over the interstate in Cass County north of Atlantic, resulting in a brief closure there as well.  Meanwhile, the area of thunderstorms over central Iowa increased in strength.  Heavy rainfall ensued over Tama County with an additional four inches of rainfall in a couple hour time period.  Serious flooding was reported in Tama and Montour with water around three feet deep in the streets of both towns.  The storms weakened over central and eastern Iowa during the early evening as they moved southeast.  The storms over west  central and southwest Iowa remained severe as they moved south-southwest out of the Des Moines County Warning Area.",Mostly tracked through rural area,PDC

The storms began in western Massachusetts during the late afternoon, with numerous reports of downed trees, wires, and large hail in Hampshire and Hampden Counties.  Hail as large as golf balls was reported in Granby.Northampton received the brunt of the storm damage, where a brief tornado and microburst caused extensive damage and one injury.  The tornado, rated F1 on the Fujita Scale with winds of 73 to 112 mph, touched down very briefly at 5 pm EDT in the higher elevations in Leeds, in the northwest section of Northampton.  A few minutes later, the same tornado briefly touched down again near Bridge Road in the Pine Brook Farm portion of Northampton.  The initial touchdown was only 15 yards wide at its maximum, about one half mile long, and lasted only one minute.  It began near Kennedy Road, just to the west of the southern portion of Roberts Meadow Reservoir.  It ended on the east side of the reservoir at Reservoir Road.  Convergent tree damage was noted in these areas.  The majority of the damage from this severe thunderstorm occurred from a very powerful microburst, with estimated winds between 90 and 105 mph, which affected the section of Northampton around Pine Brook Curve, Emily Lane, and Hatfield Street.  Straight line wind damage was observed in this area, with large trees snapped in the middle, and in some cases at their bases.  Four homes were declared uninhabitable due to large trees which had fell upon them.  Hundreds of trees were downed as well as power lines.  Hail, ranging in size from quarter to golf ball, accompanied this storm.  Amazingly, only one minor injury occurred.  A man was struck by a tree which fell into his kitchen, but was spared by his refrigerator, which acted as a shield according to several accounts.In central and eastern Massachusetts, thunderstorm winds downed trees, branches, and power lines throughout many communities in Worcester, Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Plymouth Counties.  Dime to nickel size hail also accompanied the storms.  At Logan International Airport in Boston, a wind gust to 62 mph was reported.About 15,000 electric customers lost power during the storms as they moved through Massachusetts.",Brief touchdown in Leeds and Pine Brook Farm sections of Northampton,PDC

The storm produced a prolific path of large hail, a brief tornado, and a significant wet microburst across central and east central Wisconsin.  The storm was one of the most damaging thunderstorms in Wisconsin history, producing well over $100 million in damage.The thunderstorm developed north of a warm front, which was located across the Wisconsin/Illinois border.  The setup was favorable for what is known as ""elevated"" convection; that is, the source of the instability was aloft, and not surface-based.  Elevated convection often produces large hail, and the May 12 storm was no exception.As the storm moved into central Wisconsin, numerous reports of large hail were received from Waushara and Winnebago counties.  Baseball size hail was observed with the storm in Waushara county, two miles east of Coloma and in Dakota.  Hail damaged many of the roofs of the more than 1,000 homes in Omro (Winnebago co.) alone.As the storm intensified, it produced extensive damage across Calumet and Manitowoc counties as microburst winds developed.  Wind-driven hail shredded west-facing sides of homes and businesses that were caught in the path of the storm.The worst damage in Calumet county was in and around Chilton, where 2 inch hail and hurricane-force wind gusts (estimated near 80 mph) knocked holes in siding and tore the walls and roofs from some buildings.  Over 1000 homes were damaged in the city of Chilton.  Two hundred more sustained damage in the township of Charlestown.A brief tornado occurred as the storm entered Manitowoc county, but did no damage.  At about 1150 a.m. CDT, microburst winds near 100 mph and 2 inch hail combined to produce very serious damage in St. Nazianz.  Most of the homes in a mobile home park in St. Nazianz were overturned or knocked off their foundation by the straight-line wind.  Thirty people were injured in Manitowoc county, most in St. Nazianz.    In Manitowoc county, over 100 homes were destroyed by the combination of wind and hail.

Rapid destabilization ensued later in the morning across eastern Illinois and northern Indiana with CAPES to 3500 j/kg by early afternoon.  VAD wind profiles showed 850 millibar winds in excess of 50 knots in advance of the upper trough by afternoon and as storms developed along the left over outflow boundary across Illinois... they quickly became severe and organized into a large bow echo and moved quickly eastward into northern Indiana causing extensive wind damage.  By late afternoon... a short segmented squall line developed just ahead of this bow echo squall line and extended from a St. Joseph to Fulton county line.  Along the southern end of this line... an embedded tornadic supercell developed and interacted with a left over storm-scale outflow boundary to produce the Wabash/Kosciusko and DeKalb county tornadoes.  The lack of significant low level shear likely prevented a much larger and more widespread tornado event especially across Whitley and Allen counties where several funnel clouds were captured on film but failed to touch down.,"The tornado touched down again, hitting a farm at 1300 N and 100 W.  A man suffered a broken leg here.  Two hog sheds and a large grain bin were destroyed.  A 200-yard swath of trees were uprooted to the northeast along the railroad tracks.  Another man suffered back and chest injuries as the tornado continued to the intersection of 1300 N and Meridian Road  and demolished the barn in which he stood.

Several storms produced winds in excess of 55 MPH, large hail, frequent lightning, and very heavy downpours.  One storm produced a 4 mile long F1 tornado on the north side of Charlottesville.  At 7:45 PM a tornado touched down about 2 miles west of Charlottesville on the north side of Farmington Country Club and downed several trees.  It moved northeast across Barracks Road to Albemarle High School where it took insulation from underneath modular classrooms and splattered it along nearby walls.  The storm then crossed Hydraulic Road and Route 29 near Albemarle Square Shopping Center where it blew out a plate-glass window, injuring one customer. The tornado moved into the Woodbrook neighborhood where it damaged a few homes and trees then dissipated around 7:55 PM EDT.  Hundreds of trees in the path of this 300 yard wide tornado were downed or snapped.  The hardest hit areas were along Route 250 and Owensville Road, including the neighborhoods of Farmington, West Leigh, and Glenaire.  Just south of the tornado's path, straight line winds estimated between 80 and 100 MPH downed several trees, power lines, and telephone poles.  A storage place and its contents were also destroyed and homes nearby reported minor damage. One parked car and several guard rails were flattened by downed trees. Nearly 16,000 area customers lost power after the storm struck. In Loudoun County, quarter sized hail fell near the Route 15 Potomac River bridge northeast of Taylorstown.  Pea sized hail fell in South Riding.  Winds estimated between 70 and 90 MPH downed several trees near Snake Hill Road north of Middleburg.

In Alexandria, downed trees blocked a portion of the George Washington Parkway north of Key Bridge and King Street.  Ten townhouses reported shingle and siding damage.  In Fairfax County, numerous trees were downed onto power lines, roads, and homes in the southern part of the county.  Hardest hit communities included Springfield, Mt. Vernon, Mason Neck State Park, and Ft. Belvoir.  A  wind gust of 53 MPH was recorded in Centreville and a gust of 90 MPH was recorded at Ft. Belvoir.  A home in Centreville caught on fire after being hit by lightning, resulting in $80,000 in damage.  Pea sized hail fell in Annandale.  In Prince William County, several trees and power lines were downed in Woodbridge.  A number of homes were damaged by fallen trees across the county.  Penny to golfball sized hail fell in Gainsville and quarter sized hail fell northwest of Nokesville.  Dime to quarter sized hail fell in Manassas and penny sized hail fell in Manassas Park.  Winds gusted to 52 knots at the Manassas Airport at 6:46 PM EDT.  Nearly 60,000 residents of Northern Virginia lost power as a direct result of the storm.  In Orange County, trees and power lines were downed around 8:00 PM EDT.  In Fauquier County, golfball to tennis ball sized hail fell in Warrenton, damaging hundreds of cars, windows, and roofs.  Hail damage was estimated at 1 million dollars. A wind gust of 64 MPH was measured in Warrenton.  Walnut sized hail was reported in the northwest portion of the county where winds gusted to 65 MPH.  A tree fell onto a power line near Warrenton.  In Page County, several trees and power lines were downed near Luray and Rileyville.  One car on Cave Hill Road was hit by a falling tree.  A homeowner on Yager Spring Road reported part of a roof peeled back and a downed chimney.  Nearly 3100 county customers lost power and two homes where hit by lightning.

Rapid destabilization ensued later in the morning across eastern Illinois and northern Indiana with CAPES to 3500 j/kg by early afternoon.  VAD wind profiles showed 850 millibar winds in excess of 50 knots in advance of the upper trough by afternoon and as storms developed along the left over outflow boundary across Illinois... they quickly became severe and organized into a large bow echo and moved quickly eastward into northern Indiana causing extensive wind damage.  By late afternoon... a short segmented squall line developed just ahead of this bow echo squall line and extended from a St. Joseph to Fulton county line.  Along the southern end of this line... an embedded tornadic supercell developed and interacted with a left over storm-scale outflow boundary to produce the Wabash/Kosciusko and DeKalb county tornadoes.  The lack of significant low level shear likely prevented a much larger and more widespread tornado event especially across Whitley and Allen counties where several funnel clouds were captured on film but failed to touch down.,"The last farm was hit when the tornado was located just west of 1300 S and 400 E in Kosciusko County.  Two barns, a garage, and several outbuildings were completely destroyed with some of the foundations swept clean.  The house and two cars were severely damaged from large pieces of flying debris.

The most significant cluster of thunderstorms developed over southern Columbia county and proceded to move east/southeast through Dodge, Jefferson, Waukesha, Milwaukee, and Racine counties. A supercell on the west end of this cluster, with a well-defined mesocyclone, produced some damaging straight-line winds and large hail up to 2.25 inches in diameter in Jefferson County, but could only generate a rotating wall cloud at its base in that county.  This supercell continued to dump large hail as it moved across Waukesha County, but once it moved over the city of Franklin in southwestern Milwaukee County, it spawned a tornado at 1730CST about 3/4 of a mile northwest of the intersection of Highways 41 and 100 (27th St. & Ryan Rd, or about 5.4 miles southwest of Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport). This tornado tore east/southeast through Oak Creek, and then exited Milwaukee County at 706 pm, where Highway 32 goes south into Racine County (or about 7 miles south/southeast of Mitchell Field).  The tornado continued for about .2 miles into Racine County, just east of Highway 32, before dissipating about 2.9 miles northeast of Husher. Luckily, no one was injured or killed by the tornado that traveled through Franklin and Oak Creek into Racine County. It intensified to a F1 rating as it damaged buildings, and turned over several semi-tractor trailers at a truck stop at the intersection of I-94 and Ryan Rd.  This tornado damaged at least a dozen homes in Franklin and Oak Creek, as well as one business and one utility building. Hundreds of trees were uprooted and blown over, but luckily many of them fell between buildings!  Sixty power poles were snapped by the tornadic winds in Oak Creek.  In Franklin, a 40-foot TV antenna was pushed over into a neighboring home, and a 20-foot camper was severely damaged.  Eyewitness reports indicate that this tornado was rain-wrapped and was multi-vortex at times.  Just south of the Ryan Rd. and 27th St intersection, a spotter indicated that sustained winds were greater than 40 mph for 15 minutes as the tornado passed just to the north of their position.  In Racine County, the tornado uprooted trees as it weakened.The area from Johnson Creek to the Rome and Sullivan in Jefferson county sustained considerable hail and wind damage.  Several vehicles on Interstate 94 near Johnson Creek, and in the Rome to Sullivan area, had windows broken by the large hailstones up to 2.25 inches in diameter.  In addition, a few large trees were uprooted.  Some of the corn crop in this swath had leaves stripped off.  NWS employees at the NWS office southeast of Sullivan identified a rotating wall cloud about 3 or 4 miles west of their location.Waukesha County was raked by four rounds of severe storms.  The 1st round possessed hurricane-force winds gusting to 68 knots (78 mph) at the Waukesha Airport near I-94.  The city of Brookfield sustained tree and power line damage from this wet macroburst.  The Jefferson County supercell constituted round #2  as it raked an area from Dousman to North Prairie (Waukesha Co.) with large hail and powerful downburst winds gusting to a measured 61 knots (70 mph).  Hundreds of trees were uprooted and many power lines were downed. In North Prairie, 2 homes and a car sustained tree-inflicted damage.  As this supercell moved east/southeast across Waukesha County, its strength pulsed upwards again and the Brookfield to New Berlin area experienced powerful downburst winds (round #3) that leveled more trees and power lines.  A roof on an apartment complex in New Berlin was partially ripped off by the winds, but luckily no one was injured.  Later in the evening, the 4th round of severe storms hit the Delafield to City of Waukesha area. Hail stones of almost an inch in diameter fell and powerful winds pushed over some trees.Racine County residents suffered the effect of 2 rounds of severe storms. Many trees and power-line poles were leveled in both rounds.  At least 60 power-line poles were pushed over.  At least 50 homes and 3 farm buildings in eastern Racine County were damaged by the powerful winds, or by felled trees.  Scattered severe storms also produced large hail and/or damaging winds which leveled trees in Madison (Dane County), and southern Washington County (Richfield and Germantown).Collectively, about 70 thousand customers were without power at one time or another during the afternoon and evening hours on July 2nd due to downed power lines or lightning strikes to transformers.  Twenty-five thousand of these were in Franklin and Oak Creek alone.Minor urban/small stream flooding affected parts of Waukesha and Racine Counties, as well as much of Milwaukee County after the 1st round of storms moved through and dumped rainfall of 1 to 2 inches.  Water depths on roads were reported to be 6 to 12 inches.  As with previous episodes of severe weather across southern Wisconsin during May and June, flash flooding occurred later in the evening on July 2nd, as additional rounds of storms, some severe, moved across the area.  Torrential downpours, sometimes reaching an inch or more within 15 minutes, produced flash flooding across the southern half of Milwaukee County, the area from Hartland and Waukesha to Brookfield and Elm Grove in Waukesha County, and in/near the city of Racine (Racine Co.).  Water depths on roads in these areas reached 1 to 4 feet.  The flood waters resulted in gravel shoulder washouts on roads, structural damage to basements, damage to basement contents, and culvert damage. In the city of Franklin (Milwaukee Co.), a home's basement walls collapsed due to the pressure of the flood waters.  Most small streams and creeks in Waukesha, southern Milwaukee, and eastern Racine County quickly exceeded flood stage by 1 to 2 feet due to the intense rainfall.The Root River in Franklin, the Root River Canal at Raymond (Racine Co.), Oak Creek in South Milwaukee, and the Menomonee River in Wauwatosa all crested between 2115CST on July 2nd and 0315CST the next morning.  Homes and businesses near these locations sustained the worst flood damage.  Collectively, the Milwaukee County flash flooding damaged 6974 residential homes, 38 businesses, 1 utility building, and 9 agricultural buildings.  About 600 acres of farm land in southern Milwaukee County sustained crop damage.  In Racine County, 429 residential buildings were damaged by flash flood waters, and about 2800 acres of farm land had crop damage or soil erosion.Urban/small stream flooding was reported in the city of Madison, in Sullivan, and around Richmond (Walworth Co.) due to the heavy rainfalls.  Water depths on roads were in the 6 to 18 inch range.  The Madison area picked up 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rainfall (Madison Truax Field had 1.89"" for the day), the Sullivan area picked up an estimated 2.5 to 3.0 inches, and 3.7 inches fell in Richmond on the 2nd.  No flood damage was reported from these locations.Two separate lightning strikes in Franklin started fires that damaged a car and a home's garage. Twenty-four hour rainfall amounts (mostly in the late afternoon and evening hours on July 2nd) ending 0600CST on July 3rd across southeast Wisconsin were impressive:Waukesha County...7.00"" in Elm Grove, 5.06"" at Carroll College, 4.27""in HartlandMilwaukee County...6.50"" in Greenfield, 5.05"" south side of Milwaukee, 4.75"" in West Allis, 4 to 6"" in Franklin, 4.22"" at Milwaukee Mitchell International AirportRacine County...5.76"" at Raymond, 3.99"" in the city of RacineThe 4.42 inches of rain recorded at Milwaukee General Mitchell International Airport on July 2nd, set a new record for the day and a new daily record for any day in July.

Milwaukee would finish the month of July 2000 with 7.12 inches of rain, the 3rd wettest July on record.Synoptically, an old frontal boundary sagged south across southern Wisconsin as low pressure moved east along it.

Reports of softball size hail were recorded south of Loomis with hail nearly as large in Holdrege.  Automobiles, houses, and agricultural buildings all sustained damage in southwest Phelps county.As the storm moved southeast, it severely damaged about 33,000 acres of crop and pasture land in western Harlan county.  The sheriff reported drifts along Highway 89 south of Orleans stretched for 8 miles, or to about the Kansas state line.  The nearly 4 inch rain which followed the hail fell on top of 5 inches of rain just a few days earlier.  Losses due to land erosion were estimated at $70,000.

VAD wind profiles showed 850 millibar winds in excess of 50 knots in advance of the upper trough by afternoon and as storms developed along the left over outflow boundary across Illinois... they quickly became severe and organized into a large bow echo and moved quickly eastward into northern Indiana causing extensive wind damage.  By late afternoon... a short segmented squall line developed just ahead of this bow echo squall line and extended from a St. Joseph to Fulton county line.  Along the southern end of this line... an embedded tornadic supercell developed and interacted with a left over storm-scale outflow boundary to produce the Wabash/Kosciusko and DeKalb county tornadoes.

Rapid destabilization ensued later in the morning across eastern Illinois and northern Indiana with CAPES to 3500 j/kg by early afternoon.  VAD wind profiles showed 850 millibar winds in excess of 50 knots in advance of the upper trough by afternoon and as storms developed along the left over outflow boundary across Illinois... they quickly became severe and organized into a large bow echo and moved quickly eastward into northern Indiana causing extensive wind damage.  By late afternoon... a short segmented squall line developed just ahead of this bow echo squall line and extended from a St. Joseph to Fulton county line.  Along the southern end of this line... an embedded tornadic supercell developed and interacted with a left over storm-scale outflow boundary to produce the Wabash/Kosciusko and DeKalb county tornadoes.  The lack of significant low level shear likely prevented a much larger and more widespread tornado event especially across Whitley and Allen counties where several funnel clouds were captured on film but failed to touch down.,"Once the previous tornado lifted up into the clouds, the thunderstorm cell moved northeast when this second tornado touched down and followed a skipping path near CR 60.

Rapid destabilization ensued later in the morning across eastern Illinois and northern Indiana with CAPES to 3500 j/kg by early afternoon.  VAD wind profiles showed 850 millibar winds in excess of 50 knots in advance of the upper trough by afternoon and as storms developed along the left over outflow boundary across Illinois... they quickly became severe and organized into a large bow echo and moved quickly eastward into northern Indiana causing extensive wind damage.  By late afternoon... a short segmented squall line developed just ahead of this bow echo squall line and extended from a St. Joseph to Fulton county line.  Along the southern end of this line... an embedded tornadic supercell developed and interacted with a left over storm-scale outflow boundary to produce the Wabash/Kosciusko and DeKalb county tornadoes.  The lack of significant low level shear likely prevented a much larger and more widespread tornado event especially across Whitley and Allen counties where several funnel clouds were captured on film but failed to touch down.,"The initial tornado touchdown occurred near the intersection of SR 15 and 114.

The damage path extended from Gothenburg to Beaver City and Stamford.  Wind driven hail and torrential rain shredded crops, broke windows and caused considerable property damage.  Agricultural losses were in the tens of millions of dollars.  This storm was likely the worst this generation had experienced, and ""old-timers"" had to remember back to 1937 for a comparable storm.  The severe thunderstorm complex started early in the afternoon in the Nebraska Sand Hills and dropped south rapidly.  Widespread reports of 70 mph winds were received from western Dawson county.  A brief tornado set down 3 miles northeast of Farnam.  The tornado lifted a garage over a house and ""sucked"" all of the items from the walls in the house.  Golf ball size hail ripped apart crops and pasture in southwest Dawson county to the tune of 11 million dollars in loss.The storm progressed south across Gosper county with 70 mph winds and 1 inch hail.  Power poles were broke and considerable soil erosion was reported in the county.  As the storm reached Furnas county around 6:30 pm, it intensified some and the result was extensive property damage throughout the county.  At the Southern Valley school south of Oxford, repairs of one million dollars were needed to fix the roof of the school and other structures near the school.  Water damage was reported in many parts of the school.  Windows were broken on buses and vehicles near the school grounds.  Many homes in Furnas county sustained considerable hail damage to the north side.  Windows were broken and siding damaged.  Buildings on farms throughout the county were lost.  Crop loss to the wheat, corn, and soybean crop was estimated at 15 million dollars.Just to the east, Harlan county did not escape the wrath of the storm.  Dime size hail and 70 mph winds pummeled the Stamford and Oxford areas.  Again, property damage was widespread to homes, businesses, and outbuildings.  Crop loss in the western part of the county was nearly 7.5 million dollars.

Over 300 windows in this small town were broken and nearly every home in the town sustained some damage to windows, siding or the roof.  One person was injured as she and her family tried to run for cover from the storm.  The wind blew her across the kitchen of her home and into the dining room.  She sustained head, neck and leg injuries and was transferred to a hospital in Kearney, Nebraska.  The local grain company had seven grain bins and two unloading facilities demolished.  About 1200 customers lost power during the storm.  Wind gusts to 80 mph and hail the size of quarters were also reported in Agra and Logan.As the storm moved south into Rooks county, it spawned a brief tornado north of Webster Lake.  The funnel set down about 1 mile north of the reservoir but did little if any damage.  Just days earlier, outdoor warning devices were installed at the lake area and they were put into use to alert the public on this day.  Eighty mile an hour winds were common in Rooks county and resulted in up-rooted trees, downed power lines,  roof and building damage.

They produced one F1 tornado, one funnel cloud, and high winds that downed many trees and power lines and caused at least 11 injuries, 8 of which were in New York City.Based on a storm survey performed by NWS staff, an F1 tornado occurred around 7:05 pm EDT in the continental village region of the town of Cortlandt, about 3 miles north of Peekskill on the Westchester and Putnam Counties border.  The tornado was classified as an F1 based on tree damage and their associated patterns.  Touch down was on the southwest corner of the intersection of Highland Drive and Heath Terrace.  The tornado moved northeast along the southeast shore of Cortlandt Lake in a counter-clockwise arched pattern lifting just south of the intersection of Schuyler Lane and Putnam Road.  The Path Length was about 0.3 miles and Path Width averaged 33 yards.  In the vicinity of Tyron Circle and Putnam Road, the tornado was at its' widest and strongest.

Traveling in a northeasterly direction the tornado moved from a rural, unpopulated area of the Black Warrior River into an area of homes south of Shelton State Community College. The tornado crossed SR 69 destroying a nearly complete shopping center which included a Winn Dixie store. East of SR 69 the tornado destroyed a number of houses and residential structures. As the tornado reached US 82 it destroyed a number of mobile homes where several deaths were reported. From US 82 the tornado continued northeasterly downing numerous trees and power lines and damaging residential structures. The tornado crossed I-20/59 just west of exit 77 where many trees were uprooted or snapped off. Minor damage occurred to the JVC manufacturing facility. At exit 77 a number of commercial structures including hotels, fast food restaurants, and truck stops sustained damage including a number of vehicles that were overturned. The tornado continued northeasterly for a couple of miles before dissipating rapidly. Ironically, the tornado dissipated as it moved into an open, unpopulated area. The tornado was spawned by a supercell thunderstorm that originated in Mississippi. This thunderstorm was responsible for additional tornado damage in St. Clair and Etowah counties.Tuscaloosa EMA reported 11 fatalities with this tornado along with 144 injuries. Nine of the fatalities occurred in mobile homes, one in a vehicle, and one in a commercial building converted to residential use. Six of those killed were females and five were males. Ages ranged from 16 months to 83 years old.  There were 251 single family dwellings affected (43 destroyed, 76 with major damage, 138 with minor damage), 179 mobile homes affected (79 destroyed,  23 with major damage, 77 with minor damage), and 13 businesses affected (1 destroyed, 7 with major damage, 5 with minor damage).The tornado was on the ground for a total of 18 miles, all within Tuscaloosa County. The tornado path was estimated to be 750 yards wide at it's maximum intensity. This tornado was rated an F4 on the Fujita Scale for tornado intensity. Tornado intensity varied along the path with considerable F2 and F3 damage in the area from just west of SR 69 to US 82 in the Hinton Place and Hillcrest Meadows areas as well as the Bear Creek area. It was also in these areas where pockets of F4 destruction occurred. The tornado first touched down at 12:54 PM and dissipated at 1:12 PM with a forward speed of approximately 60 MPH.

As the 35 mile long line of thunderstorms moved southeast through Dane, northern Green, and Rock Counties, it increased in strength, ultimately producing straight-line winds estimated up to 100 knots (115 mph), heavy rains at a rate of 1 to 3 inches per hour, and hail stones 1 inch in diameter.  Due to downed power lines and poles, ultimately about 18,000 customers had electrical power disrupted for 1 to 2 days.  Descriptions of weather-related events follow in a county-by-county breakdown.Dane County:Powerful thunderstorm winds, estimated at 56 knots (65 mph), toppled several large trees in and near the city of Belleville. There were no reports of injuries or deaths. Minor urban-type flooding was noted due to intense rain accompanying the storm.Green County:The squall-line intensified as it clipped the northeast quarter of Green County. Based on inflicted damage, winds gusts were estimated to be 74 knots (85 mph).  The worst-hit area extended from a subdivision west of the village of Dayton (Town of Exeter), east/southeast to the county line.  About 50 homes sustained varying amounts of damage caused by felled trees, tree branches, or the wind outright. Damage to home siding and roofs was also noted.  Hundreds of trees were toppled, about 2 dozen farm buildings were damaged or destroyed, several silos were damaged, and two semi-tractor trailers were overturned.  Many power lines were either blown over or knocked down by tree debris.Rock County:This county bore the brunt of the storm as its straight-line winds intensified to an estimated 100 knots (115 mph). The macroburst damage path was 3 to 6 miles wide, extending from southwest of Evansville in the Town of Magnolia (Highway 59 and A) east/southeast through the city of Janesville to southeast of Avalon near Caver Roehl Park.  A newspaper headline nicely stated the effects:  Rain! Wind! Wow!  The powerful winds leveled thousands of trees (some 200 years old); tore roofs off homes; businesses, and farm buildings; blew tops of silos off, flipped over vehicles; blew in windows; damaged or peeled off home siding; knocked over billboards and road signs; closed many roads due to debris, and flattened corn and soybean fields.  Based on newspaper photographs and eyewitness accounts, maximum wind gusts were estimated to be in the 87 to 100 knots range (100 -115 mph).  The worst of the damage appeared to be equivalent to that caused by tornado winds of about 115 mph, or at the bottom of the F2 category.  Many people noted that the sky grew very dark as the storm blew in with a wall of white rain mixed with tree leaves and branches. The city of Janesville was at ground zero, as a 3.7 square mile looked like a bomb had hit its downtown area and the near east and west sides.  A roof was torn off one business, and bricks were pealed off another business.  It took at least 2 weeks to remove the tree debris from city streets, sidewalks, and backyards.  Dozens of vehicles were damaged by felled trees and branches.  It is estimated that 400 to 500 city homes sustained some degree of damage (6 destroyed).  Traxler and Bond Parks looked like disaster areas and were closed.  About 50 electrical poles were snapped by tree debris or the winds.  One person in the city was injured when a tree fell on their pickup truck.  Just north of Janesville on Interstate-90, another person was injured when their SUV was flipped over by the winds. In addition, 5 semi-tractor trailers were overturned on I-90 in the same vicinity. A new sub-division 3 miles south of Janesville experienced extensive roof or siding damage due to the winds or tree debris.  Several vehicles were damaged as well. Just to the south of the city, the wastewater treatment plant recorded 1.48 inches of rain as the storms moved through, resulting in urban flooding. There were other unofficial reports of 2 to 3 inches in the city area.The civil Town of Magnolia, in the western part of the county, was also hard hit by the macroburst, especially near and along Highway 59 and County Trunk Highway A.  About 40 power poles in this Town were toppled by the winds or tree debris.A little further north on Croft Road, just southwest of Evansville, a local resident noted this sequence of events: the initial, powerful winds and blinding rains lasted for about 5 minutes and were followed by hailstones up to 1 inch in diameter. Then the rain and hail stopped.  After a couple minutes he noticed across the road in a field a ground-based vortex pulling corn stalks up to about 200 feet above the ground, while above it at cloud base was a funnel cloud.  This weak vortex then hit a barn and caused slight damage before dissipating.  Shortly thereafter, another round of rain, and gusty, but much weaker winds occurred.  Based on this resident's account, and their prior experiences with tornadoes while living in Texas, this vortex was classified as a tornado. The macroburst continued to inflict wind damage to a point about 3 miles east/southeast of the Janesville city limits along Highway 14, at which point it weakened.  However, the thunderstorms briefly intensified once again southeast of the village of Avalon near Carver Roehl Park.  At this location, a barn's roof was lifted and dropped by powerful winds, resulting in a collapsed structure which trapped 40 steer.  Fifteen of the steer died from injuries, and some of the hay bales were destroyed.  Collectively across Rock County, about 4500 acres of corn and soybean crops were badly damaged or destroyed. Thirty-five farm buildings had minor damage, 8 had major damage, and 19 were destroyed by the winds. Walworth County:The remains of the squall-line generated downburst winds which leveled large trees in and near the city of East Troy.Racine County:The remains of the squall-line generated downburst winds which leveled large trees west of Waterford.Kenosha County:The remains of the squall-line generated downburst winds which leveled large trees southwest of the village of Twin Lakes.Milwaukee County:The remains of the thunderstorms dumped rain amounts of 2.25 to 3.1 inches across Milwaukee County based on Ham reports.  Moderate urban flooding resulted.  A West Allis motorist was rescued from their stalled vehicle due to water depths of 1.5 to 3 feet in low spots on roads.  Similar water depths on strees were noted elsewhere in the county, especially in the southern half.  No damage was reported. Synoptically, an upper level trough was moving across Wisconsin on August 5th, with a weak vorticity maxima over the southern part of the state moving east/southeast. The south winds of a low-level jet fed the storms as west-northwest flow at 18,000 feet intensified to 60 knots based on profiler data.  Thunderstorm echo tops were 40 to 42,000 feet.",Narrative is incorporated in discussion of August 5th storms below.,PDC

At it's widest, path width was estimated at 30 yards.  The tornado was witnessed by a naval officer who described the tornado as a well defined rope-like funnel which was occasionally lighted by exploding transformers and power line arching at the base of the funnel.  Damage along the path was confined to shingle damage to a number of homes, a power pole snapped off at it's base and a 3 foot diameter tree uprooted.  No injuries occurred with this tornado and damage estimates were not available.",PDC

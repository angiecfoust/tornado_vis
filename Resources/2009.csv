One of these storms produced large hail in Stonewall County during the early afternoon.||More significant severe storms developed during the late afternoon hours, as convection initiated along another pre-existing outflow boundary and its intersecting triple point with a dryline. These storms developed in a very unstable airmass, and low-level wind shear along and north of the outflow boundary was sufficient to promote tornado development. Supercell thunderstorms that developed near this boundary began to produce tornadoes and very large hail over the northeastern South Plains and the extreme southeastern Panhandle shortly after 15:00 CST. While several of the tornadoes were relatively long-lived and appeared to be capable of significant damage, they remained over open range land. Only a single instance of tornado damage occurred, when an EF-1 tornado downed wooden utility poles along Farm to Market Road 97 near Cedar Hill in northeastern Floyd County. ||The most significant public impacts from these storms occurred in Paducah (Cottle County), where a massive high-precipitation supercell produced very strong winds and wind-driven hail that damaged vehicles, light structures, trees, and utilities.

These funnel clouds developed from just south of Atwater to 14 miles southeast of the city of Merced. At 11:32 AM PST, the Oakland FAA Flight Service Office called with a report from a pilot over Merced County who had just observed one of the funnels briefly touch down in an open field 10 miles south of Castle Airport. Because of the brevity of the touchdown (only a few seconds) and fortunate lack of damage, this tornado was likely an EF-0 on the enhanced Fujita scale. This was the first tornado to touch down in the central/southern San Joaquin Valley (and the entire Hanford Warning/Forecast Area) since the Visalia tornado on January 27th, 2008. The last tornado to occur in Merced County was on March 28th, 2006.||After the trough moved east of California, the very cold airmass remained over the San Joaquin Valley, bringing frost to the area on the morning of February 10th. Subsequent troughs moved into California on the 11th, 13th and 15th, as short-wave impulses rotated around an upper-level low off the northern California coast.","The Federal Aviation Administration office located in Oakland, CA, relayed a pilot report of a brief touchdown of a tornado 10 miles south of Merced Castle Airport. The tornado only last for a couple minutes and caused no property damage. The tornado was rated EF0. The pilot reported the tornado quickly lifted and dissipated. At the time of the report, the funnel had lifted and was dissipating. The touchdown occurred during a period of several funnel cloud reports over an area from Atwater to southeast of Merced Municipal Airport (KMCE).",CSV

The thermodynamic environment was marginally unstable but becoming more unstable with time. Supporting factors for severe weather were: large-scale atmospheric ascent, forcing associated with an ejecting short wave trough, significant shear, and increasing sunshine along and behind the warm front as it lifted north.||At 1343 EST the first severe weather report occurred with a measured thunderstorm wind gust of 91 MPH in Vincennes in Knox county.

Despite the occurrence of thirteen tornadoes across the South Plains region, most of the damage resulted from destructive hail and heavy rainfall.  ||Thunderstorms first developed over the northern South Plains around 13:00 CST. These early afternoon storms initiated as supercells, but transitioned into a small-scale convective complex that produced extensive amounts of large hail and heavy rainfall. As the storms trained over the Interstate 27 corridor in Swisher County, a significant hail accumulation and flood event resulted in some 50 vehicles becoming stalled and a prolonged closure of the highway through the overnight hours.||Additional storms developed during the mid to late afternoon hours over the central South Plains. Two supercell thunderstorms impacted Lubbock County. One of these storms produced a destructive hail swath through the city of Lubbock damaging some 3,000 homes and more than 1,100 vehicles totaling an estimated $40 million in damages. Meanwhile a second supercell storm over eastern Lubbock County produced a family of weak tornadoes along U.S. Highway 82 east of Idalou. ||Other supercell storms impacted portions of Garza and Kent Counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. These storms additionally produced damaging hail and brief tornadoes.||By late evening, storm modes transitioned toward broken convective complexes and multicell structures. An unstable low-level environment, however, continued to be characterized by an increasingly enhanced veering of the wind fields. Thus, despite a transition toward less discrete storm cells, the threat for tornadoes remained. Multiple small scale low-level circulations developed within the evolving convective complexes, and these circulations proved to be tornadic. An EF-1 tornado damaged five structures and downed power poles as it tracked nearly eight miles across northwestern Lubbock County and southwestern Hale County around 20:00 CST. Two additional EF-1 tornadoes impacted the Abernathy (Hale County) and Roosevelt (Lubbock County) areas through the 21:00 CST hour. Meanwhile, similar tornadic circulations developed within other storm complexes over portions of Dickens, Kent, and King Counties. Multiple reports of tornadoes were received from rural areas around the Spur, Girard, and Guthrie vicinities but no damages resulted.||In all, an estimated $41.3 million in damages and three injuries resulted from severe weather across the South Plains region of west Texas on the 16th.","Another tornadic circulation developed within a broken convective complex near the Roosevelt community in eastern Lubbock County during the 21:00 CST hour on the 16th.

The tornadic winds were sufficient to collapse a low-end and dated 20x30 foot barn and to damage the skirting and roofing of a mobile home near that intersection. A small metal awning also was blown off of a business and a fence was blown down as the tornado moved northeastward into open country. Skywarn storm spotters observed the tornado and associated utility power flashes about three and a half miles southeast of Idalou just before it dissipated at 21:20 CST. ||Damage to the barn supports an EF-1 rating, with estimated wind speeds approaching 95 mph.

The setup for the event featured a slow moving warm front that was draped from far northwest Missouri southeastward into central Missouri. This front had been reinforced by a complex of thunderstorms that had impacted northern Missouri during the overnight and early morning hours prior, allowing abundant low level moisture to become pooled along the front. Strong daytime heating along and south of the front sent temperatures into the middle and upper 80s. With strong instability and moisture in place by late afternoon, conditions were ripe for rapid thunderstorm development as an upper level disturbance moving through Kansas provided the lift necessary for thunderstorms. However, it was the strong turning and increase in winds with height (known as wind shear) that set the stage for severe storms, specifically supercells.||While these extremely photogenic storms thankfully were not damaging tornado producers, June 7th featured some of the most destructive hail ever observed across northern Missouri, with two separate storms producing softball and grapefruit size hail, leaving widespread destruction to trees, homes, and vehicles.",A brief EF0 tornado touchdown occurred in rural land at 1913 CST.

Several storms evolved into supercells, and produced very large hail, destructive winds, and weak tornadoes.||Thunderstorms initiated around 14:00 CST over the central South Plains, and quickly became severe with large hail initially reported in Lubbock (Lubbock County). More intense and organized supercell storms formed over the Rolling Plains by the mid to late afternoon hours, however, and moved southeastward. One particularly organized and long-lived high precipitation supercell impacted the Aspermont vicinity of Stonewall County, where it produced a swath of damaging winds and at least one tornado. A 100 mph wind gust and a corresponding 32 millibar pressure drop was measured when the tornado struck the Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet site northeast of Aspermont. Although no injuries were reportedly related to the tornado, severe gusts north of Aspermont overturned a tractor trailer truck injuring the driver.||Additional supercells impacted portions of Briscoe and Hale Counties, and very large wind-blown hail caused damages in both counties. Two tornadoes were observed by storm chasers in the Silverton and Quitaque vicinity of southern Briscoe County.  ||Total economic damages were estimated near $650,000 across the South Plains region.","A tornado tracked southeast through rural areas near Aspermont between 17:25 CST and 17:35 CST. This tornado was obscured by precipitation and blowing dust within a massive high precipitation supercell. Although storm chasers observed suspicious storm features and small debris fallout that led them to believe a tornado was lurking within the bear's cage, visual observations of the tornado were virtually non-existent. The tornado, however, struck a Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet site three miles northeast of Aspermont at 17:30 CST. Both meteorological data from the mesonet and a post-storm survey confirmed the occurrence of this tornado.||The tornado developed near the intersection of Farm to Market Roads 3431 and 1263 two and a half miles north of Aspermont. Texas Department of Transportation signs were blown in multiple directions near the intersection, and a 200 yard path in broken utility poles displayed distinctly different fall patterns than the many additional downed poles along the broader swath of ambient thunderstorm winds. ||Two homes along Farm to Market Road 3431 were damaged east of the intersection. The most significant damage included a partially removed roof and the destruction of two barns. Multiple stock trailers were rolled, with one apparently displaced some distance and unaccounted for. A resident witnessed the event and described strong northwesterly winds, then a period of relatively light winds. During the calm, three white funnels were seen approaching the property; followed by the onset of a loud roar and an intense wind that caused the structure's roof to lift.||The damage path remained visible in native mesquite tree damage and damage to fences and utilities southeastward to the mesonet site located three miles northeast of Aspermont. At 17:30 CST the automated station recorded a peak gust of 100 mph and a corresponding brief surface pressure drop of 32 millibars. A guy wire to the station was broken, but significant operational damage did not occur. ||The end of the tornado's path was difficult to discern, but it is believed the tornado dissipated before it reached U.S. Highway 380 east of Aspermont. Although evidence of additional tornadoes was not found in Stonewall County, the supercell cycled again and produced a significant tornado in adjacent parts of Haskell County.||Tornado related damages are estimated at $100,000, with approximately $350,000 in total losses attributed to both wind and tornado activity in the Aspermont vicinity on the 13th.

The first area was along Bushnell Drive just north of Compton Road. A well built 2-storty brick home was almost completely destroyed with just part of the kitchen wall remaining standing. The second area was near the intersection of Haynes Drive and Sulphur Springs Road. Three homes on Cornwall Court were completely destroyed and thrown clear of their slab foundations, however|it did not appear any of the homes was properly anchored.||The third area of enhanced damage was along Battleground Drive between |D`Ann Drive and Tomahawk Trace. The National Weather Service Assessment team was joined by a Murfreesboro Code who assisted with assessing construction quality at this location. Three homes were completely  blown clear of their foundations and destroyed. One home was not |anchored/fastened to the foundation, however, the other 2 were very well constructed. Several trees were also debarked at this location.||Additional information provided by the Rutherford County EMA through a newspaper report stated that over 845 homes were damaged, of these 117 were destroyed, 298 had major damage, 175 had minor damage, and another 255 were affected in some way. 519 Structures were also affected, including 77 destroyed, with an additional 300 plus homes and structures impacted in some way just outside of the city limits.

Just behind this farm house, several large trees were broken near their base with one tree uprooted.  Most of these trees were around three feet in diameter.  Some internal rot was noted in a few of the trees making them more susceptible to wind damage.  The tornado then appears to have lifted briefly before touching down again just behind a home along County Road 2200 East, between County Roads 2100 North and 2150 North.  At this location, significant tree damage was observed with multiple limbs between one and two feet in diameter being broken and falling in a convergent manner.  Also at this location, a detached garage was destroyed with debris being scattered 50 to 100 feet to the northeast.  This appears to be the point along the damage path where the tornado reached its maximum intensity with an estimated peak wind speed of 105 mph and a width of 50 yards.  The tornado then crossed County Road 2100 East causing damage to corn along both County Road 2100 East and County Road 2150 North.  After crossing County Road 2150 North, the tornado destroyed a barn housing farming equipment, measuring 44 by 72 feet.  Debris from this barn was scattered in all directions from the barn's original location.  Several pieces of farm equipment estimated to weigh between 5,000 and 15,000 pounds were moved several feet north and northeast of their original location including a grain wagon which was lifted and placed on top of other farm equipment.  After destroying the barn, the tornado moved northeast through a corn field where additional crop damage was observed.  The tornado then again briefly lifted before striking a home and a detached garage along County Road 2340 East.  Siding and minor roof and shingle damage was observed on the house and the detached garage lost its roof and suffered a collapse of the south wall.  At this location, the tornado was estimated to be about 40 yards wide.  The tornado appears to have lifted as it crossed County Road 2340 East.",CSV

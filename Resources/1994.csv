One storm moved over the Cedar Rapids Airport, producing a 46 mph wind gust.  Another storm did become severe over extreme eastern Iowa.  As it moved over Louisa County, it dropped dime-size hail on Columbus Junction, and produced 60 mph winds in Wapello.  The wind downed several trees in the city of Wapello.  The airmass over Iowa was very cold in the middle and upper levels.  During the later part of the afternoon, this led to the formation of several cold air funnel clouds over north central Iowa.  There were several reports from Pocahontas and Buena Vista Counties around 1700 CST.  Later in the evening, a tornado touched down in Clayton County.

During the early morning hours, three other features combined to once again produce severe weather in the state.  The surface dry line was advancing east across Kansas and southeast Nebraska.  At the same time a strong low level jet had become established with speeds in excess of 55 kts.  Above this a strong jet stream was in place in the upper levels.  What is known as a speed maximum (a jet streak) rotated around the upper trough and ejected toward Iowa.  This set the stage for rekindling of strong thunderstorms.  At this time, moisture was much more limited so thunderstorms were more of the pulse variety and were not able to maintain their strength as in a supercell storm.  Hail and winds were the trademarks of these storms.  Hail of three-quarters of an inch to one inch in diameter pelted Adams and Adair Counties.  Many of the other storms only produced pea- to occasional marble-size hail.  One storm became quiet strong for a while.  It was the southern most storm in the line.  It produced 60 mph winds as it passed through both Greenfield and Corning.  Another storm developed a couple hours later and moved into central Iowa.  High winds blew into the west part of Ames causing damage to trees and buildings.  A tornado developed on the southwest part of the storm a short time later.  It tracked through the western parts of the city.  It touched down near new United States Highway 30 and lifted as it crossed old Highway 30.  Several buildings were damaged or destroyed.  Windows were broken out on several houses and cars in the area.  Power was knocked out in the area as well.",CSV

The left or western thunderstorm entered Montgomery County in Royersford and wind related damage intensified as the thunderstorm moved northeast through Royersford.  Most of the damage  (collapsed porches and downed trees) in Royerstown occurred from Fifth Avenue to Lewis Road and from Main to Chestnut Streets  Several homes were damaged by falling trees.  Lewis Road was closed for two days because of tree removal. From police and eyewitness reports apparently a funnel cloud was working its way toward the ground over Royersford and became a tornado in Limerick just to the northeast of Linfield Road at 10:45 pm EST.  The tornado intensified into a strong (F3 on the Fujita Scale) one as it paralleled Limerick Road on its western side.  A development called ""The Hamlet"" was in the direct path of this tornado.  The Hamlet was a new development started within the past 2 years and about 30 of the planned 430 units were occupied or under construction.  The  development took a direct hit from the tornado.  This resulted in 3 deaths (the same family) and 25 injuries.  Of the 27 inhabited houses, 4 were leveled, 16 were damaged beyond repair, 1 under construction was destroyed and only 7 remained liveable.  Damage in this development alone was $2 million.  The family of three which lost their lives lived on Victory Way.  They were asleep and blown out of their house.  The father was found on the front lawn.  The mother and her 10-month-old daughter were found over a sewer grate.  A United States Savings Bond in the child's name was found the next day in Bath, Pennsylvania.  Bath is located about 50 miles northeast in Northampton County.  Another man was blown through the second story window of his house about 50 feet into the family room of his neighbor's house and survived.  Equally miraculous a 5-month-old infant sailed out of his crib onto the front lawn of his home and survived. As tragic as the devastation was at ""The Hamlet"", it was not the only place in Limerick to sustain damage.  As the tornado traveled through the business area of the town,  it leveled most of the Hide and Seek Storage Sheds (damage estimated at $1 million). It peeled part of the roof off the Limerick Diner.  None of the 30 patrons inside  were injured.  The Atlantic and Sunoco Gas Stations sustained major damage.  Gasoline pumps at the Sunoco Station were wrenched from their cement foundation.  An overturned beige truck lay about 200 yards from where it was parked.  Even the Limerick Fire House sustained about $25,000 in wind damage.  In addition to ""The Hamlet"", 14 other homes in Limerick sustained major damage.  About 90 persons in Limerick had to find temporary shelter.  Total damage in Limerick alone was estimated between $5 and $5.5 million. The tornado lifted in the Limerick Garden of Memories Cemetery, but its parent thunderstorm continued to produce wind related damage in upper (northwestern) Montgomery County.  Downed trees were reported in Zieglersville.  In Marlboro Township about 50 to 60 trees were uprooted on Swamp Creek and Miller Roads.  About 10 properties were damaged by the falling trees, including one house that had six trees on top of it.  A lightning ignited fire extensively damaged a West Marlborough home.  It took six fire companies to get it under control. (M28P), (F28P), (F1P)",CSV

There were unconfirmed reports of funnels in the Horseshoe Bay area, four miles southwest of Marble Falls, before the storm arrived.  Spotty damage was reported to roofs in the Horseshoe Bay area.  The tornado first struck the west side of the city, crossing a heavy commercialized and residential area.  Roofs were severely damaged at this time with several structures sustaining F1 and F2 damage.  Several boats at a dealership were tossed on top of each other.  Two-by-four's were embedded into the side of a church preschool care center, penetrating an inside classroom wall by four to five feet.  Fortunately, all children had been moved into hallways just before the tornado arrived.  Numerous commerical signs were down with widespread roof damage.  This damage became even more extensive as the tornado moved across the northern part of the city.  Marble Falls primary school also sustained damage, but students had been evacuated to the main school.  Trees were uprooted on the school grounds and damage was reported to outbuildings.  Metal I-beams were bent at a nearby metal building, indicating F2 to F3 damage.  Three nearby semi-tractor trailer delivery trucks and a bread delivery truck were overturned.  Two of these trucks were reported to have been lifted ""two to three feet off of the ground"" as they were overturned.  At a nearby Wal-Mart department store 100 to 200 employees had taken shelter, having practiced their severe weather drill the day before.  The store was hit and severely damaged, with the employees sustaining only a few minor injuries.  Additional roof damage was reported at Marble Falls High School.  Students had just executed a tornado drill as the storm struck.  There was extensive peeling of metal from the auditorium and gymnasium roofs. In summary, over 440 homes sustained damage, with one house and 17 mobile homes destroyed and major damage to 36 homes.  Eighteen businesses reported major damage with 47 others reporting minor damage.  In addition, two bridges were damaged, along with severe damage to schools.

A short time later three-quarter inch diameter hail pelted the area.  High winds caused damage in Plymouth County around LeMars.  Numerous trees and power lines were downed.  Part of a building was destroyed south of LeMars.  The local utility company recorded a wind gust of 75 mph.  A funnel cloud was sighted a short time earlier west of town.  The storms clipped the far northwest corner of the state as well.  Winds gusted to 78 mph at Sioux Center, causing damage around town.  A funnel cloud was sighted in Lyon County at Alvord.  A tornado also touched down in the area, a short distance east of Alvord.  It struck two farms, causing extensive damage to each.  Several buildings were downed on a farm near Hull, a machine shed, garage, and brooder coop were downed north of Hull.  The storms worked their way northeast.

Only a few became severe.  A severe thunderstorm moved through Winfield in Henry County, downing several trees.  Another storm produced a brief microburst south of Newton in Jasper County.  Many large tree limbs, up to 20 inches in diameter, were torn off.  Crops were flattened in a narrow strip for about a mile downstream.  Another storm produced a brief spin up tornado in Benton County.  The tornado was observed by a boater as it touched down on Rogers Park Lake.  It sucked up water briefly before breaking apart.  One could call it a waterspout since it did occur over water, however meteorologically it had thunderstorm structure of a land event.

The airmass remained very unstable with surface dew point temperatures in the lower to middle 70s.  The moisture layer was deep with 850 mb dew point temperatures around 15° C.  Thunderstorms occurred during the early morning hours over western Iowa.  The outflow boundary from that complex advanced into the central part of the state by sunrise.  Thunderstorms developed throughout the day along this outflow boundary.  During the afternoon hours they became severe.  Several tornadoes were spawned.  Two weak tornadoes touched down briefly in north central Iowa.  One was in Winnebago County, the other in Worth County.  Neither of them caused any significant damage as they occurred in open country.  A fairly strong tornado touched down in Chickasaw County.  The tornado touched down southwest of New Hampton and tracked northeast.  It his a truck repair shop at the intersection of U.S. Highway 63 and County Highway B54.  The roof was removed from the repair facility.  Most of the tornado track was through open country, which kept damage to a minimum.  The same parent storm caused high winds at the intersection of U.S. Highway 63 and Iowa Highway 18.  The winds removed the roof from a car wash there and also damaged several cars in the parking lot there.  Debris from the tornado broke windows and punctured the tires on two trucks in the lot.  Another tornado made a cameo touchdown in a field north of Clermont in Fayette County.  In addition to the tornadoes, there were a few other funnel cloud reports.  None of these touched down to become tornadoes.  Many of the storms over the east half of the state produced gusty winds and small hail.  Only a few were strong enough to become severe.  One storm caused wind damage in Bremer County.  High winds blew the roof off of a barn and downed trees and power lines south of Plainfield.  Another storm uprooted several trees in Waverly.  Damage of $10,000-$15,000 was reported in Fredericksburg as high winds damaged the roof of a service station.",CSV

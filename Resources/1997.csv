The front initiated many severe thunderstorms and three tornadoes in Columbia County.  In Columbia County near Copake Lake, an F1 tornado produced minor damage to two houses, scattered parts of a barn across county highway 7A  and downed many trees and wires.  In Columbia County near Canaan, two tornadoes produced extensive damage.  The F1 tornado formed just southwest of Beebe Pond, moved northeast and terminated near the intersection of state routes 295 and 22.  The tornado damaged several residences and moved a car port.  The F2  tornado initiated near the intersection of state routes 295 and 22 and moved eastward across the New York border into Berkshire County Massachusetts where it ended as an F1 tornado.  At the County Caretaker Lawn and Garden Center, four large greenhouses incurred structural damage.  On Shaker Ridge Road, a newly constructed three story home had the roof completely blown off along with the rear exterior wall.  The detached garage was blown off the foundation and destroyed.  Since this area is forested, many trees and wires were downed by the tornadoes resulting in power outages.  At the South Albany Airport near Selkirk, thunderstorm winds destroyed a Cessna 172 and a vintage1940's Luscombe 8E.  The winds also ripped a roof off a garage and downed several trees.  In Schoharie County at Charlotteville, straight line winds rolled over a mobile home with five people inside.  A  second mobile home which was unoccupied was lifted on top of the rolled over mobile home.  The five people sustained  injuries.  In Rensselaer County at Stephentown, thunderstorm winds lifted a barn and dropped it on East Road.  Many trees and power lines were also downed by the wind.  The thunderstorms also produced hail in parts of Schoharie, Washington, Albany and Columbia Counties.  A combination of damaging winds and lightning, left fifteen to twenty thousand people without power across eastern New York.  A lifeguard at the Northhampton Beach State Campsite in Northville was struck by lightning.  The individual was hospitalized and released with no serious injuries.",,PDC

The front initiated four tornadoes.  The Richmond F1 tornado is a continuation of the F2 tornado which occurred in Columbia County.  This tornado downed trees and produced minor damage to one house as it diminished in the Richmond area.  The tornado in the Town of Florida began at the intersection of South County Road and Savoy Road.  The F1 tornado tracked eastward and terminated just south of Florida near state route 2.  The tornado removed all the shingles off the roof of a residence and a prefabricated steeple was blown off a church.  Many trees were also downed along its path.  The F2 tornado which began in the Monterey area started at the intersection of Wellman Road and New Marlborough Road.  The tornado tracked northeast across state route 23 and Lake Garfield to Hayes Pond where it merged with the second tornado.  At the north end of Hayes Pond the tornado diminished.  This tornado downed hundreds of trees, damaged ten to twenty homes and destroyed two vehicles.  The damage was most extensive along the north shore of Lake Garfield at Elephant Rock Road, Hopi Road, Mt. Hunger Road and Norwalk Acres Road.  The second F2 tornado began near the intersection of Tyringham Road and West Center Road.  It then tracked across Hayes Pond where it momentarily merged with the other tornado.  The tornado then proceeded northeast where it ended near the intersection of state route 8 and Merrit Road.  This tornado produced extensive tree damage, destroyed one vehicle and damaged fifteen to twenty homes.  The most extensive damage occurred along West Center Road near Hayes Pond.  Baseball size hail was also observed at Hayes Pond with this storm.  Two people were struck by lightning at the Great Barrington Fairgrouds.  They were both hospitalized and released.",,PDC

Millions of dollars in damage resulted from the biggest severe weather outbreak to affect the region in years.The storms began to develop early in the afternoon across north-central Wisconsin.  Hail the size of baseballs fell in Minocqua (Oneida co.), damaging nearly 200 vehicles.  As those storms moved southeast and weakened, a new supercell thunderstorm developed over Lincoln county.  This new storm produced wind damage in Tomahawk and softball size hail northeast of Merrill.  About 20 minutes later, a tornado developed in southeast Lincoln county and moved southeastward into Marathon county.  This tornado, rated F2, was on the ground for more than three miles.  It damaged several homes, vehicles and silos, and destroyed numerous barns, sheds and crops.  Twenty head of dairy cattle were killed or had to be destroyed.  As  the tornadic supercell moved southeast, it produced two other weak tornadoes.  Total damage to crops and property from five tornadoes, hail and straight-line winds in Marathon county alone topped $10 million.Another supercell thunderstorm produced a downburst swath of damage over three miles wide and 14 miles long from southeast Langlade county, through western Menominee county, into extreme north-central Shawano county.  Menominee county was especially hard hit, as tens of thousands of trees were felled in the heavily forested county.  Authorities estimated that nearly 25 million board feet of lumber was on the ground; it was hoped that much of it was going to be salvaged.  At the height of the storm, winds were estimated to be near 100 mph.  As the storm weakened and moved into north-central Shawano county, a 70 mph wind gust was measured near Morgan.  Another storm in western Shawano county produced a downburst which downed trees across the city of Wittenberg.  Part of a roof was blown off an apartment building in the downtown area, and several houses and businesses sustained damage from the fallen trees.  A Wittenberg man was injured by flying glass.  Lightning set a house on fire, destroying the second story, in the township of Germania.Another storm struck Waupaca county, producing high winds.  A power pole fell and hit a car in New London, injuring the driver.Shortly after 530 pm, a supercell thunderstorm produced numerous wind gusts over 65 mph across the Fox Valley, blowing over many trees, damaging buildings and causing a fatality.  A 36 year-old male was killed when a tree fell on his minivan in Oshkosh (Winnebago co.).  His young daughter was uninjured in the accident.  A wind gust to 82 mph was measured in Appleton (Outagamie co.), and a gust to 67 mph was recorded in Oshkosh.Thunderstorms over Waushara county produced flooding rains, a brief tornado, strong winds and hail.  Over five inches of rain fell in only three hours near Hancock, producing some basement and street flooding.  A brief tornado also touched down in an open field in Hancock.  Numerous trees and powerlines were blown down in Wautoma.A thunderstorm knocked trees and power lines down in Kiel (Calumet/Manitowoc co.), and damaged seven tents at a fair in Cleveland (Manitowoc co.).",,PDC

The two tornadoes, both resulting in damage and rated F1, occurred in Wichita County southeast of Burkburnett and in Clay County in the Charlie area.  The first tornado was on the ground in Wichita County for about 3/4 mile and the second in Clay County for about 6.5 miles.  A damage survey was conducted by a National Weather Service meteorologist on the 17th, the day after the storm.  Both radar signatures and this survey indicated that the two tornadoes were produced by the same storm.  See individual Storm Data entries on these tornadoes for further details.While the tornadoes did produce significant structural damage, severe straight-line thunderstorm winds caused much more widespread damage across the region.  Peak measured wind speeds reached 70 mph in Vernon in Wilbarger County and at Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita County.  Reports of structural damage came from Knox City in Knox County, Mankins in Archer County, Petrolia in Clay County, and Electra, Wichita Falls, and Burkburnett in Wichita County.  Tree, limb, and power line damage was also reported in Quanah in Hardeman County, Vernon in Wilbarger County, Archer City in Archer County, and Henrietta in Clay County. The largest reported hail fell near Lake Kemp in Baylor County, where hail reached the size of golf balls. See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.","A survey conducted by a National Weather Service meteorologist confirmed that an F1 tornado touched down briefly about 5 miles southeast of Burkburnett (or 1.5 miles north of the north end of Sheppard AFB).  One mobile home was completely destroyed on Bobby Point Road, prompting an F1 rating. Several other mobile homes in the area sustained minor damage, and homes to the east on Carriage Lane also received minor damage. Maximum path length was about 3/4 mile and the width was 50 to 60 yards.",PDC

Millions of dollars in damage resulted from the biggest severe weather outbreak to affect the region in years.The storms began to develop early in the afternoon across north-central Wisconsin.  Hail the size of baseballs fell in Minocqua (Oneida co.), damaging nearly 200 vehicles.  As those storms moved southeast and weakened, a new supercell thunderstorm developed over Lincoln county.  This new storm produced wind damage in Tomahawk and softball size hail northeast of Merrill.  About 20 minutes later, a tornado developed in southeast Lincoln county and moved southeastward into Marathon county.  This tornado, rated F2, was on the ground for more than three miles.  It damaged several homes, vehicles and silos, and destroyed numerous barns, sheds and crops.  Twenty head of dairy cattle were killed or had to be destroyed.  As  the tornadic supercell moved southeast, it produced two other weak tornadoes.  Total damage to crops and property from five tornadoes, hail and straight-line winds in Marathon county alone topped $10 million.Another supercell thunderstorm produced a downburst swath of damage over three miles wide and 14 miles long from southeast Langlade county, through western Menominee county, into extreme north-central Shawano county.  Menominee county was especially hard hit, as tens of thousands of trees were felled in the heavily forested county.  Authorities estimated that nearly 25 million board feet of lumber was on the ground; it was hoped that much of it was going to be salvaged.  At the height of the storm, winds were estimated to be near 100 mph.  As the storm weakened and moved into north-central Shawano county, a 70 mph wind gust was measured near Morgan.  Another storm in western Shawano county produced a downburst which downed trees across the city of Wittenberg.  Part of a roof was blown off an apartment building in the downtown area, and several houses and businesses sustained damage from the fallen trees.  A Wittenberg man was injured by flying glass.  Lightning set a house on fire, destroying the second story, in the township of Germania.Another storm struck Waupaca county, producing high winds.  A power pole fell and hit a car in New London, injuring the driver.Shortly after 530 pm, a supercell thunderstorm produced numerous wind gusts over 65 mph across the Fox Valley, blowing over many trees, damaging buildings and causing a fatality.  A 36 year-old male was killed when a tree fell on his minivan in Oshkosh (Winnebago co.).  His young daughter was uninjured in the accident.  A wind gust to 82 mph was measured in Appleton (Outagamie co.), and a gust to 67 mph was recorded in Oshkosh.Thunderstorms over Waushara county produced flooding rains, a brief tornado, strong winds and hail.  Over five inches of rain fell in only three hours near Hancock, producing some basement and street flooding.  A brief tornado also touched down in an open field in Hancock.  Numerous trees and powerlines were blown down in Wautoma.A thunderstorm knocked trees and power lines down in Kiel (Calumet/Manitowoc co.), and damaged seven tents at a fair in Cleveland (Manitowoc co.).",,PDC

The two tornadoes, both resulting in damage and rated F1, occurred in Wichita County southeast of Burkburnett and in Clay County in the Charlie area.  The first tornado was on the ground in Wichita County for about 3/4 mile and the second in Clay County for about 6.5 miles.  A damage survey was conducted by a National Weather Service meteorologist on the 17th, the day after the storm.  Both radar signatures and this survey indicated that the two tornadoes were produced by the same storm.  See individual Storm Data entries on these tornadoes for further details.While the tornadoes did produce significant structural damage, severe straight-line thunderstorm winds caused much more widespread damage across the region.  Peak measured wind speeds reached 70 mph in Vernon in Wilbarger County and at Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita County.  Reports of structural damage came from Knox City in Knox County, Mankins in Archer County, Petrolia in Clay County, and Electra, Wichita Falls, and Burkburnett in Wichita County.  Tree, limb, and power line damage was also reported in Quanah in Hardeman County, Vernon in Wilbarger County, Archer City in Archer County, and Henrietta in Clay County. The largest reported hail fell near Lake Kemp in Baylor County, where hail reached the size of golf balls. See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.","A damage survey conducted by a National Weather Service meteorologist revealed a 6.5 mile tornado track across northern Clay County.  The tornado began around 20:50 CST about 6 miles southwest of Charlie, TX, moved northeast, and lifted about 2 miles north of Charlie.  Downed power poles and several trees on Ratt Road marked the beginning of the damage, with increasing damage through a pecan grove along Highway 171.  Damage to a barn and over 1000 trees in the grove was rated at F1.  Farther northeast along the track of the tornado, two homes and at least 3 barns/garages also sustained F1 damage along Linville and T-Bone Roads.  The roof of a house on T-Bone Road was completely blown off, probably because the garage door had been left open. The heaviest damage from this tornado was along a three mile path from the pecan grove on Highway 171 to the houses on Linville and T-Bone Roads.  Path width ranged from 50 to 100 yards.",PDC

The F2 tornado which began in the Monterey area started at the intersection of Wellman Road and New Marlborough Road.  The tornado tracked northeast across state route 23 and Lake Garfield to Hayes Pond where it merged with the second tornado.  At the north end of Hayes Pond the tornado diminished.  This tornado downed hundreds of trees, damaged ten to twenty homes and destroyed two vehicles.  The damage was most extensive along the north shore of Lake Garfield at Elephant Rock Road, Hopi Road, Mt. Hunger Road and Norwalk Acres Road.  The second F2 tornado began near the intersection of Tyringham Road and West Center Road.  It then tracked across Hayes Pond where it momentarily merged with the other tornado.  The tornado then proceeded northeast where it ended near the intersection of state route 8 and Merrit Road.  This tornado produced extensive tree damage, destroyed one vehicle and damaged fifteen to twenty homes.  The most extensive damage occurred along West Center Road near Hayes Pond.

Numerous trees were downed across roads, and 46 structures were damaged - some directly by the wind and others by falling trees. A small tornado occurred near Honea Path where trees, lines, and some structures and a mobile home were damaged. The strongest tornado in this area occurred south of Spartanburg, 2 miles north of Roebuck where a weak tornado became progressively stronger as it moved along terrain with increasing elevation. Where the terrain suddenly dropped off, the tornado damage ended. Several newly constructed homes were severely damaged or destroyed in the low-end F2 tornado. This was nearly doubled by the component of forward motion (55 knots). This same line segment later caused a tornado in York county which moved into the Gastonia, NC area. Most of the damage reports above were downed trees and power lines. North of Union, a 150 gallon tank was blown around. Seven miles south of Gaffney, a mobile home was blown off its foundation.

This tornado downed trees and produced minor damage to one house as it diminished in the Richmond area.  The tornado in the Town of Florida began at the intersection of South County Road and Savoy Road.  The F1 tornado tracked eastward and terminated just south of Florida near state route 2.  The tornado removed all the shingles off the roof of a residence and a prefabricated steeple was blown off a church.  Many trees were also downed along its path.  The F2 tornado which began in the Monterey area started at the intersection of Wellman Road and New Marlborough Road.  The tornado tracked northeast across state route 23 and Lake Garfield to Hayes Pond where it merged with the second tornado.  At the north end of Hayes Pond the tornado diminished.  This tornado downed hundreds of trees, damaged ten to twenty homes and destroyed two vehicles.  The damage was most extensive along the north shore of Lake Garfield at Elephant Rock Road, Hopi Road, Mt. Hunger Road and Norwalk Acres Road.  The second F2 tornado began near the intersection of Tyringham Road and West Center Road.  It then tracked across Hayes Pond where it momentarily merged with the other tornado.  The tornado then proceeded northeast where it ended near the intersection of state route 8 and Merrit Road.  This tornado produced extensive tree damage, destroyed one vehicle and damaged fifteen to twenty homes.  The most extensive damage occurred along West Center Road near Hayes Pond.  Baseball size hail was also observed at Hayes Pond with this storm.  Two people were struck by lightning at the Great Barrington Fairgrouds.  They were both hospitalized and released.",,PDC

Winds probably peaked at less than 90 mph, enough to take down trees and destroy the metal building, but stronger-built parts of the barn remained intact.At several points along the path, there was good indication of rotation in the direction trees fell.  Parts of the barn roof of the Hamblin farm were actually blown westward by the storm, while debris from the farm equipment building was spread eastward.

A large area of downburst winds struck sections of Sullivan County from Hillsgrove east across Eagles Mere to Laporte and Dushore.  While most of the damage was straight line wind, at least two locations in the Eagles Mere area had evidence of rotation indicative of a tornado.  The first path with apparent rotation began near High Knob in Wyoming State Forest.  The storm moved east taking down trees on an intermittent path for 5 miles into Eagles Mere.The second path with evident rotation crossed Route 42 north of the airport and moved east crossing Laporte Avenue on the south side of the borough of Eagles Mere.  Again, although most of the damage was downburst in origin, there were small areas with good indication of rotation in the winds.Eyewitness accounts told of rotating debris, and several remarked of hearing of funnel cloud reports, but no visual witness of a funnel was located.  Nearly all of the damage was to trees, although one tree fell and demolished a vehicle at the beach on the north side of Eagles Mere Lake.  Fortunately, all boats on the lake had been called in because of the early alerts, and trips on the motor launch that carries passengers around the lake had been suspended for the day because of the threat of severe weather.",PDC

Downburst damage covered an area of about 3 miles wide from Ganoga Lake southeast to Lake Jean.  An eyewitness at Ganoga Lake described a cloud of water being lifted off the surface of the lake.  Another told of seeing a catamaran being lifted about 30 feet off the lake surface and thrown towards shore.  The tornado appeared to cross Lake Jean and end in a campground.

Millions of dollars in damage resulted from the biggest severe weather outbreak to affect the region in years.The storms began to develop early in the afternoon across north-central Wisconsin.  Hail the size of baseballs fell in Minocqua (Oneida co.), damaging nearly 200 vehicles.  As those storms moved southeast and weakened, a new supercell thunderstorm developed over Lincoln county.  This new storm produced wind damage in Tomahawk and softball size hail northeast of Merrill.  About 20 minutes later, a tornado developed in southeast Lincoln county and moved southeastward into Marathon county.  This tornado, rated F2, was on the ground for more than three miles.  It damaged several homes, vehicles and silos, and destroyed numerous barns, sheds and crops.  Twenty head of dairy cattle were killed or had to be destroyed.  As  the tornadic supercell moved southeast, it produced two other weak tornadoes.  Total damage to crops and property from five tornadoes, hail and straight-line winds in Marathon county alone topped $10 million.Another supercell thunderstorm produced a downburst swath of damage over three miles wide and 14 miles long from southeast Langlade county, through western Menominee county, into extreme north-central Shawano county.  Menominee county was especially hard hit, as tens of thousands of trees were felled in the heavily forested county.  Authorities estimated that nearly 25 million board feet of lumber was on the ground; it was hoped that much of it was going to be salvaged.  At the height of the storm, winds were estimated to be near 100 mph.  As the storm weakened and moved into north-central Shawano county, a 70 mph wind gust was measured near Morgan.  Another storm in western Shawano county produced a downburst which downed trees across the city of Wittenberg.  Part of a roof was blown off an apartment building in the downtown area, and several houses and businesses sustained damage from the fallen trees.  A Wittenberg man was injured by flying glass.  Lightning set a house on fire, destroying the second story, in the township of Germania.Another storm struck Waupaca county, producing high winds.  A power pole fell and hit a car in New London, injuring the driver.Shortly after 530 pm, a supercell thunderstorm produced numerous wind gusts over 65 mph across the Fox Valley, blowing over many trees, damaging buildings and causing a fatality.  A 36 year-old male was killed when a tree fell on his minivan in Oshkosh (Winnebago co.).  His young daughter was uninjured in the accident.  A wind gust to 82 mph was measured in Appleton (Outagamie co.), and a gust to 67 mph was recorded in Oshkosh.Thunderstorms over Waushara county produced flooding rains, a brief tornado, strong winds and hail.  Over five inches of rain fell in only three hours near Hancock, producing some basement and street flooding.  A brief tornado also touched down in an open field in Hancock.  Numerous trees and powerlines were blown down in Wautoma.A thunderstorm knocked trees and power lines down in Kiel (Calumet/Manitowoc co.), and damaged seven tents at a fair in Cleveland (Manitowoc co.).",,PDC

In all, thirteen tornadoes were confirmed, including an F2 tornado that tracked for 6 miles through McClain County southwest of Purcell.   Some minor injuries were reported with one of the tornadoes, but no fatalities or serious injuries occurred. Reports of 3-inch hail, severe straight-line winds, and lightning damage were also received.One particularly strong supercell storm tracked across central Oklahoma, reaching its maximum strength  and producing 3 tornadoes and extensive straight-line wind damage over Grady and McClain Counties.  What follows here is an excerpt from a damage survey conducted by a National Weather Service meteorologist on May 26th, the day after the storm. ""A large severe thunderstorm moved through northern and central Grady County into central and southern McClain County during the late afternoon on Sunday, 25 May 1997.  Several reports were received immediately after the storm indicating significant wind damage, especially in southern McClain County southwest of Purcell.   There also were numerous confirmed tornado sightings by storm spotters, chasers, local emergency management officials, and local residents.Findings indicate that 3 tornadoes occurred in this area.  Most of the damage, and all of the significant structural damage, resulted from the first two tornadoes. Widespread tree damage in some areas, especially in McClain County, was attributed to straight-line winds.The first tornado, rated F1, began 3 miles northeast of Tabler at 15:14 CST and tracked just south of due east for about 2.5 miles before dissipating 2.5 miles SSW of Middleberg at 15:24 CST. Structural damage was confined to a dairy farm near the beginning of the track; otherwise, this tornado remained over mostly open country.The second and more significant tornado, rated F2, began 5 miles east of Criner, or 7 miles WSW of downtown Purcell, in southern McClain County.  The beginning time of this tornado is less certain but is believed to be near or just after 16:00 CST.  This tornado also tracked just south of due east for 6 miles, ending about 4 miles NW of Wayne or 4 miles S of downtown Purcell at around 16:24 CST. Numerous power lines were downed, prompting the temporary closing of both Highways 24 and 74 for a time Sunday evening.  At least 18 dwellings, including mobile homes and permanent dwellings, were destroyed or suffered major damage.   This probably was a multiple-vortex tornado, at least in its latter stages, based on eyewitness reports. A third small tornado, rated F0, formed around 16:32 CST and  lasted about one or two minutes.  It damaged an outbuilding and a few trees 2 miles NNE of Wayne in Southern McClain County, about 4 miles east of where the second tornado ended. No one was killed or seriously injured by any of the tornadoes, but several minor injuries were reported. ""The remaining 10 tornadoes were associated with other severe thunderstorms, mainly across central and southern Oklahoma.  The strongest of these occurred south of Duncan in Stephens County at 17:36 CST.  Spotter and damage reports rated this as an F1 tornado.  The remaining 9 tornadoes were all rated F0 and resulted in little or no damage.  In chronological order, these tornadoes occurred on the Caddo Comanche County line between Cyril and Fletcher (16:27CST), south of Maysville in Garvin County (17:28 CST), east of Joy in Murray County (18:07 CST), south of Stratford in Garvin County (18:13 CST), east of Roff in Pontotoc County (18:53 CST), northeast of Mill Creek in Johnston County (19:20 CST), west-northwest of Madill in Marshall County, (19:43 CST), north of Tupelo in Coal County (19:48 CST), and northwest of Newkirk in Kay County (21:10 CST). Severe straight-line winds were estimated at up to 80 mph (southwest of Fittstown in Pontotoc County). Wind damage from thunderstorm winds occurred north of Tabler in Grady County, southwest of Purcell in McClain County, in Wynnewood in Garvin County, west of Hardy in Kay County, and west of Antlers in Pushmataha County. Hail up to 3 inches in diameter fell south of Stratford in Garvin County, and lightning damage was reported south of Duncan in Stephens County. See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.","This description, with very minimal editing, was taken from a damage survey conducted by a National Weather Service meteorologist on Monday May 26th (Memorial Day), the day after the tornado occurred.This tornado, rated F1, began 3 miles northeast of Tabler at 15:14 CST and tracked just south of due east for about 2.5 miles before dissipating 2.5 miles south-southwest of Middleberg at 15:24 CST.  The maximum width of the damage path was 75 yards.  Structural damage was confined to a dairy farm near the beginning of the track; otherwise, this tornado remained over mostly open country.Spotter observations and corresponding video confirm that the first tornado formed rapidly west of State Highway 9 at 15:14 CST, in mostly open country between Tabler and Middleberg.  Survey results located the first signs of damage to trees just west of the Mid-Am Dairy Farm (or R & S Dairy), located 3 miles northeast of Tabler.  More than a dozen trees lost large branches near and west of the dairy.  At the dairy itself, a mobile home was destroyed, power lines were downed, and two metal outbuildings suffered heavy damage to roofs and walls. Metal grain silos also were damaged. Considering the construction of the outbuildings and the large piles of hay bales near the mobile home that were relatively unaffected, damage in this area was rated F1. The maximum path width of about 75 yards, based on visible damage and on video, was estimated to be in this area.     Observations and video indicate that the tornado then proceeded eastward and eventually east-southeastward, narrowing to a thin, mostly vertical rope funnel that underwent several cycles of lifting and returning to ground contact. However, the circulation was likely in contact with the ground the entire time. The funnel crossed Highway 9 around 15:22 CST 2.5 miles southwest of Middleberg, where several trees lost large branches and a road sign was damaged.  Between the dairy and this point, the tornado track was inaccessible.  Although the funnel lifted from the ground shortly after crossing the highway, video confirms that a tight, small circulation with ground condensation persisted, crossing an open field southeast of the road. This rotation at the ground lasted about another two minutes before dissipating at about 15:24 CST.  Since the tornado passed over open country, no further damage was found.",PDC

Reports of large hail, flash flooding, damaging severe winds, and four tornadoes were received.  The first tornado, and the only tornado that caused damage, moved from west of Wakita to south of Wakita in Grant County. Because the damage was limited to power poles and trees, the tornado was rated as F0. The second and third tornadoes, both brief and rated F0, were reported near Deer Creek (also in Grant County) by the county sheriff's office.  The fourth and final tornado was observed west of Blackwell in Kay County by a county spotter.  Once again, no damage resulted and the tornado was rated F0.Severe straight-line winds officially measured at up to 81 mph (near Weatherford in Custer County) caused widespread and extensive damage in portions of western Oklahoma.  Beckham and Custer Counties were particularly hard-hit with major damage in Erick, Sayre, Elk City, Arapaho, Weatherford, Binger, and Clinton. Other wind damage also occurred in Wakita and near Medford in Grant County, in Canute and Cordell in Washita County, and in Oklahoma City in Oklahoma County.The largest hail was reported southwest of Renfrow in Grant County, where hail as large as golf balls fell. Flash flooding also occurred as storms moved repeatedly across parts of north-central Oklahoma producing very heavy rain.

In all, thirteen tornadoes were confirmed, including an F2 tornado that tracked for 6 miles through McClain County southwest of Purcell.   Some minor injuries were reported with one of the tornadoes, but no fatalities or serious injuries occurred. Reports of 3-inch hail, severe straight-line winds, and lightning damage were also received.One particularly strong supercell storm tracked across central Oklahoma, reaching its maximum strength  and producing 3 tornadoes and extensive straight-line wind damage over Grady and McClain Counties.  What follows here is an excerpt from a damage survey conducted by a National Weather Service meteorologist on May 26th, the day after the storm. ""A large severe thunderstorm moved through northern and central Grady County into central and southern McClain County during the late afternoon on Sunday, 25 May 1997.  Several reports were received immediately after the storm indicating significant wind damage, especially in southern McClain County southwest of Purcell.   There also were numerous confirmed tornado sightings by storm spotters, chasers, local emergency management officials, and local residents.Findings indicate that 3 tornadoes occurred in this area.  Most of the damage, and all of the significant structural damage, resulted from the first two tornadoes. Widespread tree damage in some areas, especially in McClain County, was attributed to straight-line winds.The first tornado, rated F1, began 3 miles northeast of Tabler at 15:14 CST and tracked just south of due east for about 2.5 miles before dissipating 2.5 miles SSW of Middleberg at 15:24 CST. Structural damage was confined to a dairy farm near the beginning of the track; otherwise, this tornado remained over mostly open country.The second and more significant tornado, rated F2, began 5 miles east of Criner, or 7 miles WSW of downtown Purcell, in southern McClain County.  The beginning time of this tornado is less certain but is believed to be near or just after 16:00 CST.  This tornado also tracked just south of due east for 6 miles, ending about 4 miles NW of Wayne or 4 miles S of downtown Purcell at around 16:24 CST. Numerous power lines were downed, prompting the temporary closing of both Highways 24 and 74 for a time Sunday evening.  At least 18 dwellings, including mobile homes and permanent dwellings, were destroyed or suffered major damage.   This probably was a multiple-vortex tornado, at least in its latter stages, based on eyewitness reports. A third small tornado, rated F0, formed around 16:32 CST and  lasted about one or two minutes.  It damaged an outbuilding and a few trees 2 miles NNE of Wayne in Southern McClain County, about 4 miles east of where the second tornado ended. No one was killed or seriously injured by any of the tornadoes, but several minor injuries were reported. ""The remaining 10 tornadoes were associated with other severe thunderstorms, mainly across central and southern Oklahoma.  The strongest of these occurred south of Duncan in Stephens County at 17:36 CST.  Spotter and damage reports rated this as an F1 tornado.  The remaining 9 tornadoes were all rated F0 and resulted in little or no damage.  In chronological order, these tornadoes occurred on the Caddo Comanche County line between Cyril and Fletcher (16:27CST), south of Maysville in Garvin County (17:28 CST), east of Joy in Murray County (18:07 CST), south of Stratford in Garvin County (18:13 CST), east of Roff in Pontotoc County (18:53 CST), northeast of Mill Creek in Johnston County (19:20 CST), west-northwest of Madill in Marshall County, (19:43 CST), north of Tupelo in Coal County (19:48 CST), and northwest of Newkirk in Kay County (21:10 CST). Severe straight-line winds were estimated at up to 80 mph (southwest of Fittstown in Pontotoc County). Wind damage from thunderstorm winds occurred north of Tabler in Grady County, southwest of Purcell in McClain County, in Wynnewood in Garvin County, west of Hardy in Kay County, and west of Antlers in Pushmataha County. Hail up to 3 inches in diameter fell south of Stratford in Garvin County, and lightning damage was reported south of Duncan in Stephens County. See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.",A tornado was reported by spotters just north of Fletcher near the Caddo/Comanche County line. (This is the same tornado as 4 SW Cyril in Caddo County.)  No reported damage.,PDC

He said there was more than one vortex and that each one formed and dissipated rather quickly. He estimated that the individual vortices were as little as 6 feet across.

During the daylight hours, the storms produced numerous reports of large hail and strong and damaging winds. Two tornadoes were also reported.  By the end of the evening, a widespread flash-flood event had evolved, affecting most or all of 5 counties in the area. The first tornado was reported west of Bluegrove (on the south side of Lake Arrowhead) in Clay County, and the second tornado, probably a gustnado, occurred south of Deer Creek (also in Clay County). Minor damage was reported with each tornado and both were rated F0.  The largest hail also fell near Lake Arrowhead, where baseball-sized hail fell for about 10 minutes.  The strongest measured wind speeds reached 76 mph at the Wichita Falls Municipal Airport in Wichita County.  Widespread and severe wind damage occurred in Harrold in Wilbarger County and in Iowa Park in Wichita County.  Other more minor damage was reported east of Red Springs in Baylor County, in Oklaunion in Wilbarger County, in Archer City in Archer County, and south of Deer Creek in Clay County.Most of Clay and Archer Counties were affected by flash flooding.  Portions of Wichita Falls in Wichita County also suffered from major flash flooding, including flooding of homes.  More isolated incidents of flash flooding occurred near Benjamin in Knox County and near Seymour in Baylor County.

These touched down, then dissipated in order.The first tornado in Williamson County formed near 2:25 pm CST and built rapidly to F2 strength.  It survived for approximately 8 minutes, often returning briefly to a roped and tilted feature before it died.  This tornado was followed by a second that formed near 2:35 pm CST.  It built quickly into a multi-vortex tornado that appeared to be near F2 strength as well.  This dissipated after only 4 minutes.  The final tornado from this same supercell, , the Jarrell Tornado, developed as a small...rope-shaped tornado, touching down around 2:40 pm CST inside the Williamson County line northwest of Jarrell.  From film and eyewitness accounts, it expanded quickly into a very large vortex nearly 1/2 mile in width. Observations recounted by eyewitnesses indicated that the damage path may not have been made strictly by one tornado.  A number of eyewitnesses reported seeing several small, rope-like funnels before the character of the tornado changed drastically into the killer tornado.   Ground damage patterns in the Double Creek Subdivision also suggested this possibility. The tornado crossed CR 308, CR 305, and then CR 307.  Where the tornado crossed each of these county roads, approximately 525 feet of asphalt was ripped off each of the roadways.  This particular destruction was believed to be very close to the centerline of the tornado circulation. As the tornado crossed the intersection of  CR 305 and 307, a business on the corner was destroyed.  The tornado moved into the Double Creek area at this point with total destruction.  F5 destruction continued from shortly after its formation until very close to the end of the damage path.The tornado began a brief turn toward the southeast as it entered the Double Creek subdivision and the surrounding area, moving very slowly.  It reached the subdivision at 3:48 pm.  This time is based on a clock found at a destroyed residence in the extreme northwest corner of the subdivision and the home believed to be the first struck by the tornado.   Here, it widened to it maximum width of three-quarters of a mile.  From the air, the ground appearance changed abruptly in the vicinity of CR 308 and continued until very near the end of the path.  No definitive circulation patterns or suction spots were evident, but there was the noted obvious change in the appearance of the ground.  In the Double Creek area, approximately 40 structures were totally destroyed.  One of the most striking signs in approaching this area was the distinct lack of debris of any size.  Closer inspection showed lots of little debris but no sign of large items.  It was estimated that several dozen vehicles had been in the subdivision and removed by the tornado.  Nearly 300 cattle grazing in a pasture near the subdivision were also killed, with many of them tossed and blown for over 1/4 mile.  At least half a dozen cars were identified from the air lying in the open areas, most of them flattened and encrusted with mud and grass.  Trees in the subdivision were completely stripped of bark.  Later ground survey revealed that most of the debris that was left in the area was extremely small indicating the power of the tornadic wind.  All 27 deaths associated with the Jarrell tornado occurred in the Double Creek area.  Eyewitnesses reported that it appeared to have slowed down as it entered the subdivision, and that may account for the nearly total destruction that took place.After passing through the Double Creek area, the tornado shifted its track again slightly, moving toward the south-southwest across CR 309 and into a heavily wooded area of cedar trees.  The total destruction of the tornado ends abruptly shortly after entering the wooded area.  However, a small swath of tree damage on the north side of the main damage path suggested the possibility of a multiple vortex pattern.  No other evidence of multiple vortices was observed.The sequence of  weather phenomenon reported with this tornado was exactly opposite of that often reported- the tornado first appeared, followed by nearly calm conditions, then hail, followed by rain and finally brief, gusty winds.  This is attributed to the fact that the parent supercell was moving toward the southwest for most of its life.  The storm essentially ""backed into"" the area as it moved.",,PDC

One person had to be hospitalized overnight. The last time an F4 tornado struck Middle Tennessee was on May 18, 1995. The path length of the tornado was 6.5 miles with its intensity reaching F4 and its maximum width of 300 yards.44 homes were destroyed and 47 other homes were damaged in the Barfield area. There was also damage to a Middle School, Food Lion Supermarket and to the Chalet Apartments.The tornado first touched down on Yeargan Road, about 6 miles southwest of Murfreesboro,  with an intensity of F1 and path width of 100 yards. At this location, a sheet metal roof was peeled back off a barn and a couple of trees were broken off. Also close by, a trailer was lifted off its foundation and overturned. Several trees were uprooted in the area. The tornado proceeded northeast and increased to F2 intensity with a width of 300 yards. As it struck the community of Barfield, an entire roof was lifted off a house, several homes were partially destroyed, and a barn was totally destroyed. The tornado crossed the West Fork of the Stones River and struck the Southridge Subdivision. At this time the tornado increased to a maximum intensity of F4 with its width remaining at 300 yards. About half a dozen homes were totally destroyed. The tornado then struck a large apartment complex just west of U.S. Hwy 231 on the south side of Murfreesboro. The tornado produced some structural damage and extensive roof damage as it weakened to F1 intensity and its width decreased to 150 yards. The tornado then crossed U.S. Hwy 231 and the Indian Wells Golf Course. Large trees were uprooted and structural damage occurred to several businesses as it approached I-24. The tornado continued moving to the northeast across I-24 snapping and uprooting trees as it narrowed to 50 yards wide. On the southeast side of Murfreesboro near the intersection of Elam Road and U.S. Hwy 41, and near Brandyville Road and East Rutherford Boulevard, the tornado uprooted numerous trees and damaged the roofs of several homes. It was at this point the track of the tornado ended as it lifted back into the clouds.

In all, thirteen tornadoes were confirmed, including an F2 tornado that tracked for 6 miles through McClain County southwest of Purcell.   Some minor injuries were reported with one of the tornadoes, but no fatalities or serious injuries occurred. Reports of 3-inch hail, severe straight-line winds, and lightning damage were also received.One particularly strong supercell storm tracked across central Oklahoma, reaching its maximum strength  and producing 3 tornadoes and extensive straight-line wind damage over Grady and McClain Counties.  What follows here is an excerpt from a damage survey conducted by a National Weather Service meteorologist on May 26th, the day after the storm. ""A large severe thunderstorm moved through northern and central Grady County into central and southern McClain County during the late afternoon on Sunday, 25 May 1997.  Several reports were received immediately after the storm indicating significant wind damage, especially in southern McClain County southwest of Purcell.   There also were numerous confirmed tornado sightings by storm spotters, chasers, local emergency management officials, and local residents.Findings indicate that 3 tornadoes occurred in this area.  Most of the damage, and all of the significant structural damage, resulted from the first two tornadoes. Widespread tree damage in some areas, especially in McClain County, was attributed to straight-line winds.The first tornado, rated F1, began 3 miles northeast of Tabler at 15:14 CST and tracked just south of due east for about 2.5 miles before dissipating 2.5 miles SSW of Middleberg at 15:24 CST. Structural damage was confined to a dairy farm near the beginning of the track; otherwise, this tornado remained over mostly open country.The second and more significant tornado, rated F2, began 5 miles east of Criner, or 7 miles WSW of downtown Purcell, in southern McClain County.  The beginning time of this tornado is less certain but is believed to be near or just after 16:00 CST.  This tornado also tracked just south of due east for 6 miles, ending about 4 miles NW of Wayne or 4 miles S of downtown Purcell at around 16:24 CST. Numerous power lines were downed, prompting the temporary closing of both Highways 24 and 74 for a time Sunday evening.  At least 18 dwellings, including mobile homes and permanent dwellings, were destroyed or suffered major damage.   This probably was a multiple-vortex tornado, at least in its latter stages, based on eyewitness reports. A third small tornado, rated F0, formed around 16:32 CST and  lasted about one or two minutes.  It damaged an outbuilding and a few trees 2 miles NNE of Wayne in Southern McClain County, about 4 miles east of where the second tornado ended. No one was killed or seriously injured by any of the tornadoes, but several minor injuries were reported. ""The remaining 10 tornadoes were associated with other severe thunderstorms, mainly across central and southern Oklahoma.  The strongest of these occurred south of Duncan in Stephens County at 17:36 CST.  Spotter and damage reports rated this as an F1 tornado.  The remaining 9 tornadoes were all rated F0 and resulted in little or no damage.  In chronological order, these tornadoes occurred on the Caddo Comanche County line between Cyril and Fletcher (16:27CST), south of Maysville in Garvin County (17:28 CST), east of Joy in Murray County (18:07 CST), south of Stratford in Garvin County (18:13 CST), east of Roff in Pontotoc County (18:53 CST), northeast of Mill Creek in Johnston County (19:20 CST), west-northwest of Madill in Marshall County, (19:43 CST), north of Tupelo in Coal County (19:48 CST), and northwest of Newkirk in Kay County (21:10 CST). Severe straight-line winds were estimated at up to 80 mph (southwest of Fittstown in Pontotoc County). Wind damage from thunderstorm winds occurred north of Tabler in Grady County, southwest of Purcell in McClain County, in Wynnewood in Garvin County, west of Hardy in Kay County, and west of Antlers in Pushmataha County. Hail up to 3 inches in diameter fell south of Stratford in Garvin County, and lightning damage was reported south of Duncan in Stephens County.

Four small tornadoes were confirmed:  one in northern Shenandoah Co near the town of Wheatfield, one in extreme southeast Frederick Co in the community of Double Tollgate, a third in Clarke Co near the town of Berryville, and a fourth in Loudoun Co between Mountville and Oatlands.Damage in Wheatfield was confined to a heavily wooded rural area, where 20 trees were snapped or uprooted along a narrow but distinctive path.  Winds were estimated to be around 80 mph.  It was the first tornado ever reported in the county; perhaps partially due to a NWS survey team locating the damage.  The twister lifted along the county line, later seen as a funnel near Stephens City (Frederick Co)  before dissipating.  The second small tornado touched down east of Klines Corner in southeast Frederick Co.  Five trees were downed on one farm, and damage was spotty along a 3-mile path to Double Church Road just southwest of Double Tollgate.  A spotter had previously reported a touchdown near this area.  Most of the damage was to trees, though some minor roof and fence damage was observed along and near Double Church Road.In Clarke Co, a third tornado touched down just south of Berryville.  Minor damage was noted to a roof and shingles at a house; an electric garage door was damaged as well.  A  circular pattern was noted in the tall grass and in branches that had broken off nearby trees.  Some tomato stakes and cages were pulled up and tossed.  A fourth (small) tornado path was found from Mountville to Oatlands in western Loudoun Co.  Large branches were snapped and some trees were uprooted on a narrow path along Lime Kiln Road.Scattered tree damage was noted elsewhere across the six-county area, including the towns of Reliance (Warren Co), Middletown and Stephens City (Frederick Co), Upperville (Fauquier Co),  White Post and Berrys (Clarke Co), and from Middleburg to Arcola (Loudoun).Farther east, a steel-framed fire hall, still under construction, collapsed when a near-severe thunderstorm wind gust passed through Sterling (Loudoun Co).  Approximately 150 wooden trusses supporting the frame initially fell.  A home in the nearby Cascades subdivision had a deck collapse.  However, the deck was found to have been improperly anchored to the ground  (e.g., not according to specifications).  Based on the above evidence, and the fact that only two small trees were reported down near the fire center, wind speeds were estimated to be just under severe criteria.Lightning struck and killed two horses at a farm just north of Unison.  Earlier, lightning struck a home in Stephens City, causing $60,000 in structural damage, mainly to the roof.",,PDC

In all, eight tornadoes, hail as large as golf balls, and damaging severe thunderstorm winds were reported.  No injuries or fatalities occurred as a result of the storms.The only damage reported with any of the tornadoes occurred with the first tornado 1 mile north of Cromwell in Seminole County. At this location, damage was mainly limited to outbuildings and trees and the tornado was rated F0.   Since the remaining seven tornadoes resulted in no known damage, they were also rated F0.   These tornadoes occurred in Seminole County southwest of Cromwell (17:47 CST), in Hughes County southeast of Dustin (19:00 CST), on the Johnston/Marshall County line between Russett and Madill (20:05 CST), and in Marshall County southwest of Madill (20:19 CST), south of Russett (20:20 CST), west of Little City (20:41 CST), and south of Madill (21:24 CST).In addition to the tornadoes, hail up to 1.75 inches in diameter fell in Pontotoc County northeast of Allen and in Marshall County in and north of Madill. Severe thunderstorm winds damaged trees east of Cloudy and in Cloudy in Pushmataha County. Significant structural damage was also attributed to thunderstorm winds south of Dustin in Hughes County. See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.","A tornado was seen 1 mile north of Highway 99A on Highway 56.

In all, thirteen tornadoes were confirmed, including an F2 tornado that tracked for 6 miles through McClain County southwest of Purcell.   Some minor injuries were reported with one of the tornadoes, but no fatalities or serious injuries occurred. Reports of 3-inch hail, severe straight-line winds, and lightning damage were also received.One particularly strong supercell storm tracked across central Oklahoma, reaching its maximum strength  and producing 3 tornadoes and extensive straight-line wind damage over Grady and McClain Counties.  What follows here is an excerpt from a damage survey conducted by a National Weather Service meteorologist on May 26th, the day after the storm. ""A large severe thunderstorm moved through northern and central Grady County into central and southern McClain County during the late afternoon on Sunday, 25 May 1997.  Several reports were received immediately after the storm indicating significant wind damage, especially in southern McClain County southwest of Purcell.   There also were numerous confirmed tornado sightings by storm spotters, chasers, local emergency management officials, and local residents.Findings indicate that 3 tornadoes occurred in this area.  Most of the damage, and all of the significant structural damage, resulted from the first two tornadoes. Widespread tree damage in some areas, especially in McClain County, was attributed to straight-line winds.The first tornado, rated F1, began 3 miles northeast of Tabler at 15:14 CST and tracked just south of due east for about 2.5 miles before dissipating 2.5 miles SSW of Middleberg at 15:24 CST. Structural damage was confined to a dairy farm near the beginning of the track; otherwise, this tornado remained over mostly open country.The second and more significant tornado, rated F2, began 5 miles east of Criner, or 7 miles WSW of downtown Purcell, in southern McClain County.  The beginning time of this tornado is less certain but is believed to be near or just after 16:00 CST.  This tornado also tracked just south of due east for 6 miles, ending about 4 miles NW of Wayne or 4 miles S of downtown Purcell at around 16:24 CST. Numerous power lines were downed, prompting the temporary closing of both Highways 24 and 74 for a time Sunday evening.  At least 18 dwellings, including mobile homes and permanent dwellings, were destroyed or suffered major damage.   This probably was a multiple-vortex tornado, at least in its latter stages, based on eyewitness reports. A third small tornado, rated F0, formed around 16:32 CST and  lasted about one or two minutes.  It damaged an outbuilding and a few trees 2 miles NNE of Wayne in Southern McClain County, about 4 miles east of where the second tornado ended. No one was killed or seriously injured by any of the tornadoes, but several minor injuries were reported. ""The remaining 10 tornadoes were associated with other severe thunderstorms, mainly across central and southern Oklahoma.  The strongest of these occurred south of Duncan in Stephens County at 17:36 CST.  Spotter and damage reports rated this as an F1 tornado.  The remaining 9 tornadoes were all rated F0 and resulted in little or no damage.  In chronological order, these tornadoes occurred on the Caddo Comanche County line between Cyril and Fletcher (16:27CST), south of Maysville in Garvin County (17:28 CST), east of Joy in Murray County (18:07 CST), south of Stratford in Garvin County (18:13 CST), east of Roff in Pontotoc County (18:53 CST), northeast of Mill Creek in Johnston County (19:20 CST), west-northwest of Madill in Marshall County, (19:43 CST), north of Tupelo in Coal County (19:48 CST), and northwest of Newkirk in Kay County (21:10 CST). Severe straight-line winds were estimated at up to 80 mph (southwest of Fittstown in Pontotoc County). Wind damage from thunderstorm winds occurred north of Tabler in Grady County, southwest of Purcell in McClain County, in Wynnewood in Garvin County, west of Hardy in Kay County, and west of Antlers in Pushmataha County. Hail up to 3 inches in diameter fell south of Stratford in Garvin County, and lightning damage was reported south of Duncan in Stephens County. See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.","A tornado was observed about 3 miles south of Duncan and 1 mile east of Highway 81 by storm spotters.

The fourth and final tornado was observed west of Blackwell in Kay County by a county spotter.  Once again, no damage resulted and the tornado was rated F0.Severe straight-line winds officially measured at up to 81 mph (near Weatherford in Custer County) caused widespread and extensive damage in portions of western Oklahoma.  Beckham and Custer Counties were particularly hard-hit with major damage in Erick, Sayre, Elk City, Arapaho, Weatherford, Binger, and Clinton. Other wind damage also occurred in Wakita and near Medford in Grant County, in Canute and Cordell in Washita County, and in Oklahoma City in Oklahoma County.The largest hail was reported southwest of Renfrow in Grant County, where hail as large as golf balls fell. Flash flooding also occurred as storms moved repeatedly across parts of north-central Oklahoma producing very heavy rain.

In all, thirteen tornadoes were confirmed, including an F2 tornado that tracked for 6 miles through McClain County southwest of Purcell.   Some minor injuries were reported with one of the tornadoes, but no fatalities or serious injuries occurred. Reports of 3-inch hail, severe straight-line winds, and lightning damage were also received.One particularly strong supercell storm tracked across central Oklahoma, reaching its maximum strength  and producing 3 tornadoes and extensive straight-line wind damage over Grady and McClain Counties.  What follows here is an excerpt from a damage survey conducted by a National Weather Service meteorologist on May 26th, the day after the storm. ""A large severe thunderstorm moved through northern and central Grady County into central and southern McClain County during the late afternoon on Sunday, 25 May 1997.  Several reports were received immediately after the storm indicating significant wind damage, especially in southern McClain County southwest of Purcell.   There also were numerous confirmed tornado sightings by storm spotters, chasers, local emergency management officials, and local residents.Findings indicate that 3 tornadoes occurred in this area.  Most of the damage, and all of the significant structural damage, resulted from the first two tornadoes. Widespread tree damage in some areas, especially in McClain County, was attributed to straight-line winds.The first tornado, rated F1, began 3 miles northeast of Tabler at 15:14 CST and tracked just south of due east for about 2.5 miles before dissipating 2.5 miles SSW of Middleberg at 15:24 CST. Structural damage was confined to a dairy farm near the beginning of the track; otherwise, this tornado remained over mostly open country.The second and more significant tornado, rated F2, began 5 miles east of Criner, or 7 miles WSW of downtown Purcell, in southern McClain County.  The beginning time of this tornado is less certain but is believed to be near or just after 16:00 CST.  This tornado also tracked just south of due east for 6 miles, ending about 4 miles NW of Wayne or 4 miles S of downtown Purcell at around 16:24 CST. Numerous power lines were downed, prompting the temporary closing of both Highways 24 and 74 for a time Sunday evening.  At least 18 dwellings, including mobile homes and permanent dwellings, were destroyed or suffered major damage.   This probably was a multiple-vortex tornado, at least in its latter stages, based on eyewitness reports. A third small tornado, rated F0, formed around 16:32 CST and  lasted about one or two minutes.  It damaged an outbuilding and a few trees 2 miles NNE of Wayne in Southern McClain County, about 4 miles east of where the second tornado ended. No one was killed or seriously injured by any of the tornadoes, but several minor injuries were reported. ""The remaining 10 tornadoes were associated with other severe thunderstorms, mainly across central and southern Oklahoma.  The strongest of these occurred south of Duncan in Stephens County at 17:36 CST.  Spotter and damage reports rated this as an F1 tornado.  The remaining 9 tornadoes were all rated F0 and resulted in little or no damage.  In chronological order, these tornadoes occurred on the Caddo Comanche County line between Cyril and Fletcher (16:27CST), south of Maysville in Garvin County (17:28 CST), east of Joy in Murray County (18:07 CST), south of Stratford in Garvin County (18:13 CST), east of Roff in Pontotoc County (18:53 CST), northeast of Mill Creek in Johnston County (19:20 CST), west-northwest of Madill in Marshall County, (19:43 CST), north of Tupelo in Coal County (19:48 CST), and northwest of Newkirk in Kay County (21:10 CST). Severe straight-line winds were estimated at up to 80 mph (southwest of Fittstown in Pontotoc County). Wind damage from thunderstorm winds occurred north of Tabler in Grady County, southwest of Purcell in McClain County, in Wynnewood in Garvin County, west of Hardy in Kay County, and west of Antlers in Pushmataha County. Hail up to 3 inches in diameter fell south of Stratford in Garvin County, and lightning damage was reported south of Duncan in Stephens County. See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.","This description was taken almost entirely from a damage survey conducted by a National Weather Service meteorologist. An outbuilding was damaged on a farm along a section of road 2 miles north and 1 mile east of Wayne, about 1 mile south of the south bank of the Canadian River. Sheet metal was dispersed across the area, and a few trees were damaged.  Otherwise this tornado remained in open country. Initial development, based on video, was around 16:32 CST with a duration of less than 2 minutes before it quickly dissipated.  Maximum path width was 20 yards or less, path length was 1/4 mile or less, and damage was rated F0.",PDC

Nobody remembered hearing any thunder although a minority reported some rain. A television station in Hopkinsville obtained videotape of the Oak Grove tornado. The primary damage was in a mobile home park, where a mobile home was overturned and destroyed. Two occupants of the mobile home were slightly injured, but did not require treatment at any hospital. Other mobile homes in the park were slightly damaged. An estimated 130,000 dollars damage occurred at the Fort Campbell Army Post due to a brief funnel touchdown. Most of the damage at the base occurred in the shop area of the Directorate of Logistics building, where it tore off the roof, exposing expensive test equipment. The upper part of a wall in an adjacent building was damaged.",PDC

Other wind damage also occurred in Wakita and near Medford in Grant County, in Canute and Cordell in Washita County, and in Oklahoma City in Oklahoma County.The largest hail was reported southwest of Renfrow in Grant County, where hail as large as golf balls fell. Flash flooding also occurred as storms moved repeatedly across parts of north-central Oklahoma producing very heavy rain.  Reports of flash flooding were received from Grant County in and around Medford, most of southern Kay County, and Noble County near Red Rock and Perry.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.","A tornado touched down 2 miles west of Wakita and moved southeast to a location 1 mile south of Wakita on Highway 11A.

Some minor injuries were reported with one of the tornadoes, but no fatalities or serious injuries occurred. Reports of 3-inch hail, severe straight-line winds, and lightning damage were also received.One particularly strong supercell storm tracked across central Oklahoma, reaching its maximum strength  and producing 3 tornadoes and extensive straight-line wind damage over Grady and McClain Counties.  What follows here is an excerpt from a damage survey conducted by a National Weather Service meteorologist on May 26th, the day after the storm. ""A large severe thunderstorm moved through northern and central Grady County into central and southern McClain County during the late afternoon on Sunday, 25 May 1997.  Several reports were received immediately after the storm indicating significant wind damage, especially in southern McClain County southwest of Purcell.   There also were numerous confirmed tornado sightings by storm spotters, chasers, local emergency management officials, and local residents.Findings indicate that 3 tornadoes occurred in this area.  Most of the damage, and all of the significant structural damage, resulted from the first two tornadoes. Widespread tree damage in some areas, especially in McClain County, was attributed to straight-line winds.The first tornado, rated F1, began 3 miles northeast of Tabler at 15:14 CST and tracked just south of due east for about 2.5 miles before dissipating 2.5 miles SSW of Middleberg at 15:24 CST. Structural damage was confined to a dairy farm near the beginning of the track; otherwise, this tornado remained over mostly open country.The second and more significant tornado, rated F2, began 5 miles east of Criner, or 7 miles WSW of downtown Purcell, in southern McClain County.  The beginning time of this tornado is less certain but is believed to be near or just after 16:00 CST.  This tornado also tracked just south of due east for 6 miles, ending about 4 miles NW of Wayne or 4 miles S of downtown Purcell at around 16:24 CST. Numerous power lines were downed, prompting the temporary closing of both Highways 24 and 74 for a time Sunday evening.  At least 18 dwellings, including mobile homes and permanent dwellings, were destroyed or suffered major damage.   This probably was a multiple-vortex tornado, at least in its latter stages, based on eyewitness reports. A third small tornado, rated F0, formed around 16:32 CST and  lasted about one or two minutes.  It damaged an outbuilding and a few trees 2 miles NNE of Wayne in Southern McClain County, about 4 miles east of where the second tornado ended. No one was killed or seriously injured by any of the tornadoes, but several minor injuries were reported. ""The remaining 10 tornadoes were associated with other severe thunderstorms, mainly across central and southern Oklahoma.  The strongest of these occurred south of Duncan in Stephens County at 17:36 CST.  Spotter and damage reports rated this as an F1 tornado.  The remaining 9 tornadoes were all rated F0 and resulted in little or no damage.  In chronological order, these tornadoes occurred on the Caddo Comanche County line between Cyril and Fletcher (16:27CST), south of Maysville in Garvin County (17:28 CST), east of Joy in Murray County (18:07 CST), south of Stratford in Garvin County (18:13 CST), east of Roff in Pontotoc County (18:53 CST), northeast of Mill Creek in Johnston County (19:20 CST), west-northwest of Madill in Marshall County, (19:43 CST), north of Tupelo in Coal County (19:48 CST), and northwest of Newkirk in Kay County (21:10 CST).

The beginning time of this tornado is less certain but is believed to be near or just after 16:00 CST.  This tornado also tracked just south of due east for 6 miles, ending about 4 miles NW of Wayne or 4 miles S of downtown Purcell at around 16:24 CST. Numerous power lines were downed, prompting the temporary closing of both Highways 24 and 74 for a time Sunday evening.  At least 18 dwellings, including mobile homes and permanent dwellings, were destroyed or suffered major damage.   This probably was a multiple-vortex tornado, at least in its latter stages, based on eyewitness reports. A third small tornado, rated F0, formed around 16:32 CST and  lasted about one or two minutes.  It damaged an outbuilding and a few trees 2 miles NNE of Wayne in Southern McClain County, about 4 miles east of where the second tornado ended. No one was killed or seriously injured by any of the tornadoes, but several minor injuries were reported. ""The remaining 10 tornadoes were associated with other severe thunderstorms, mainly across central and southern Oklahoma.  The strongest of these occurred south of Duncan in Stephens County at 17:36 CST.  Spotter and damage reports rated this as an F1 tornado.  The remaining 9 tornadoes were all rated F0 and resulted in little or no damage.  In chronological order, these tornadoes occurred on the Caddo Comanche County line between Cyril and Fletcher (16:27CST), south of Maysville in Garvin County (17:28 CST), east of Joy in Murray County (18:07 CST), south of Stratford in Garvin County (18:13 CST), east of Roff in Pontotoc County (18:53 CST), northeast of Mill Creek in Johnston County (19:20 CST), west-northwest of Madill in Marshall County, (19:43 CST), north of Tupelo in Coal County (19:48 CST), and northwest of Newkirk in Kay County (21:10 CST). Severe straight-line winds were estimated at up to 80 mph (southwest of Fittstown in Pontotoc County). Wind damage from thunderstorm winds occurred north of Tabler in Grady County, southwest of Purcell in McClain County, in Wynnewood in Garvin County, west of Hardy in Kay County, and west of Antlers in Pushmataha County. Hail up to 3 inches in diameter fell south of Stratford in Garvin County, and lightning damage was reported south of Duncan in Stephens County. See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.","This description was taken almost entirely, and with minimal editing, from a damage survey conducted Monday May 26th (Memorial Day), the day after the tornado, by a National Weather Service meteorologist.This tornado, rated F2, began 5 miles east of Criner, or 7 miles west-southwest of downtown Purcell, in southern McClain County.  The beginning time of this tornado is not entirely certain but is believed to be near or just after 16:00 CST.  This tornado tracked just south of due east for 6 miles, ending about 4 miles northwest of Wayne or 4 miles south of downtown Purcell at around 16:24 CST. At its widest, the damage path was estimated to be 3/4 mile wide.  Numerous power lines were downed, prompting the temporary closing of both Highways 24 and 74 for a time during the evening.  At least 18 dwellings, including mobile homes and permanent dwellings, were destroyed or suffered major damage.   This probably was a multiple-vortex tornado, at least in its latter stages, based on eyewitness reports.  No one was killed or seriously injured by this tornado, but two minor injuries were reported. Damage began along a concentrated path from along Highway 24 around 3 miles south and 1 mile east of Woody Chapel (which is located at the intersection of Highways 39 and 24 about 3 miles south of Washington).  Details are described below, highlighting six areas along the damage track.Along Hwy 24, 5 miles east of Criner, sheet metal was scattered over about a 1/4 to 1/2 mile path, apparently the remnants of a destroyed outbuilding.  Several large trees were toppled or heavily damaged in this area.  Damage was F1.  Tree damage also was noted over a larger area 1 mile west of this location (or 3 miles south of Woody Chapel on Highway 24), along with a few pieces of sheet metal debris.  Since damage in this area was more minor (small to medium size branches broken) and notconcentrated, straight-line winds were considered the likely source.  Also along Hwy 24, from Hwy 112 southward for about a mile, power lines were downed along a 1/4 to 1/2 mile stretch of the road. Considerable debris was found from fallen trees, metal outbuildings, etc. Damage was F1.  About 1 mile east of Hwy 24 and 1 mile south of Hwy 112, a home was unroofed. Widespread but mostly minor tree damage was noted, with trees uprooted and/or branches snapped off.  Aside from the home with the damaged roof, there were few if any other manmade structures in the area.  Damage probably was F1, but an exact determination could not be made since the roof was being repaired at the time of the survey.On Emu Road, 1/2 to 1 mile south of Hwy 112 and 2 miles east of Hwy 24, one permanent home was destroyed.  Numerous large trees were downed - some snapped off, and others uprooted. Several of the uprooted trees fell toward the northwest, others to the southwest.  Damage was considered F2. At Highway 74 and Horse Road, (3.5 to 4.5 miles east of Hwy 24 and 1 mile south of Hwy 112), the worst damage and widest damage path (about 3/4 mile wide) were in this area.  Power lines were downed along Hwy 74 for nearly a mile.  Numerous large trees were snapped off or uprooted.  In one area between the two roads, nearly every tree suffered some kind of significant damage. Two mobile homes were destroyed along Horse Road. One was blown east and landed across the street near a church.  The other rolled three times and landed 50 to 100 feet northeast of its original location.  Two women, a mother and daughter, were inside the second mobile home and were lucky to escape with only minor injuries.  Metal outbuildings, satellite dishes, fences, and at least one pickup truck were destroyed - mostly by impacts from other blown objects.   However, the church, which was brick, sustained only minor structural damage to the exterior, as the roof was intact and only a few shingles were missing.  (Broken windows in the church led to more substantial damage on the interior as rain and wind entered the building.)  Damage in this area was considered F2, but the fact that the church escaped with such minor damage to its exterior suggests either a lower rating or the possibility of a multiple-vortex tornado. At least one eyewitness indicated a second tornado.  Although the entire damage track appeared consistent and more-or-less continuous, suggesting only one tornado, the eyewitness account and the observed gradients in damage intensity suggest that this probably was a multiple-vortex tornado, at least in its latter stages.From 1/4 to 1/2 mile east of Horse Road, a large home suffered major damage, with most of the second floor destroyed.  Downed trees were widespread.  Damage was rated F2.  Another home immediately east of this location lost part of its roof.  But farther east, near Interstate 35, several homes were undamaged and no significant damage could be found - except for a lone uprooted tree immediately west of the interstate.",PDC

In all, thirteen tornadoes were confirmed, including an F2 tornado that tracked for 6 miles through McClain County southwest of Purcell.   Some minor injuries were reported with one of the tornadoes, but no fatalities or serious injuries occurred. Reports of 3-inch hail, severe straight-line winds, and lightning damage were also received.One particularly strong supercell storm tracked across central Oklahoma, reaching its maximum strength  and producing 3 tornadoes and extensive straight-line wind damage over Grady and McClain Counties.  What follows here is an excerpt from a damage survey conducted by a National Weather Service meteorologist on May 26th, the day after the storm. ""A large severe thunderstorm moved through northern and central Grady County into central and southern McClain County during the late afternoon on Sunday, 25 May 1997.  Several reports were received immediately after the storm indicating significant wind damage, especially in southern McClain County southwest of Purcell.   There also were numerous confirmed tornado sightings by storm spotters, chasers, local emergency management officials, and local residents.Findings indicate that 3 tornadoes occurred in this area.  Most of the damage, and all of the significant structural damage, resulted from the first two tornadoes. Widespread tree damage in some areas, especially in McClain County, was attributed to straight-line winds.The first tornado, rated F1, began 3 miles northeast of Tabler at 15:14 CST and tracked just south of due east for about 2.5 miles before dissipating 2.5 miles SSW of Middleberg at 15:24 CST.

A band of storms moved across the area bringing large hail to many counties.  Ahead of the band, however, an isolated tornadic supercell moved from Lynn County northeast across Crosby and Dickens Counties.  One of its tornadoes struck a lone, double-wide mobile home about one-half mile west of White River Lake (or about 6 miles NNE of Kalgary) in Crosby County, killing one 78 year-old male and injuring a 73 year-old female.  The couple was preparing to leave for shelter just as the tornado struck.  It totally demolished the structure and damaged a vehicle.  This same cell had caused tornadoes in southern and eastern Lynn County earlier (as reported by chasers and spotters), and proceeded to cause other tornadoes in Dickens and eastern Crosby Counties (as reported by spotters and local law enforcement).  Near Afton (Dickens Co.), a trailer was damaged, the roof of a cotton gin was ripped off, and a chimney collapsed due to a tornado.At almost the same time as the White River Lake tornado, severe winds caused damage to the Liberty Acres community just northeast of Lubbock International Airport.  Several houses were damaged (one severely) and several mobile homes were damaged (one severely), too.  The winds also knocked down four utility poles and a few trees (one of which damaged a car).  Although some people believed this storm was a tornado, a damage survey by researchers from Texas Tech's wind engineering group, as well as one by NWS officials, proved inconclusive.Minutes before the storm damaged Liberty Acres, it dropped golfball-size hail over  west parts of the City of Lubbock, damaging 3,000 to 4,000 homes as well as a few thousand vehicles.  Damages from the hail were estimated at more than $30 million.A tornado west of Plainview uprooted trees and damaged two barns.Note:  The tornado description below was added in 2005 after the report was relayed to the NWS as a result of other requests.  As the report is delayed, there is no F-rating assigned an no damage amounts have been reported.  The tornado report is included for the integrity of the database and climatological research.A tornado was reported approximately 2 miles to the northwest of Canyon Valley around 9 pm.  A residence was completely destroyed and was located 1/2 mile north of County Road 238.  The tornado is reportedly separate from the White River Lake tornado described above.  Debris from the home was scattered up to 6 miles from the residence and cedar trees where uprooted and large sandstone rocks were moved.  The debris path was reported to be an estimated 1/2 mile wide with utility poles snapped and carried four to five hundred yards south of the house.  A very heavy and anchored deer stand was blown over and damaged 1/2 mile north of the house.",,PDC

In Fairview, 6 homes sustained extensive damage and 2 had only minor damage.  Two people in Fairview sustained minor cuts and bruises, though no one needed to be taken to the hospital.  At this time the tornado was F0 in intensity.  After leaving Fairview, it travelled to the northeast.  When the tornado reached Middle Grove (Fulton County) it was F1 in intensity and damaged 25 homes.  The tornado picked up a 27 foot camper trailer and dropped it upside down 50 feet away on the north side of Route 116.  Two mobile homes were destroyed, as well as, a garage and six homes sustained extensive damage.  Also, numerous trees had their tops taken off and numerous power poles were blown down  along Route 116 and just east of Middle Grove.  No one in Middle Grove was injured despite half of the homes in the town sustaining some kind of damage.  From there the tornado hopped and skipped along a northeast path.  It touched down 1.5 miles southwest of Yates City (Knox County), destroying a grain bin and damaging several other buildings, then it touched down 1 mile east of Yates City and 3 miles west northwest of Brimfield (Peoria County), knocking down several power poles in both locations.  Four miles northwest of Brimfield, the tornado touched down again, ripping the top floor of a split level home off and destroyed a nearby shed and garage.  Two people inside the home escaped uninjured.  Then before lifting for the final time, the tornado touched down 2 miles east of Wyoming (Stark County), damaging 3 homes, destroying a machine shed, and blew the roofs off of several barns and grain silos.

Four small tornadoes were confirmed:  one in northern Shenandoah Co near the town of Wheatfield, one in extreme southeast Frederick Co in the community of Double Tollgate, a third in Clarke Co near the town of Berryville, and a fourth in Loudoun Co between Mountville and Oatlands.Damage in Wheatfield was confined to a heavily wooded rural area, where 20 trees were snapped or uprooted along a narrow but distinctive path.  Winds were estimated to be around 80 mph.  It was the first tornado ever reported in the county; perhaps partially due to a NWS survey team locating the damage.  The twister lifted along the county line, later seen as a funnel near Stephens City (Frederick Co)  before dissipating.  The second small tornado touched down east of Klines Corner in southeast Frederick Co.  Five trees were downed on one farm, and damage was spotty along a 3-mile path to Double Church Road just southwest of Double Tollgate.  A spotter had previously reported a touchdown near this area.  Most of the damage was to trees, though some minor roof and fence damage was observed along and near Double Church Road.In Clarke Co, a third tornado touched down just south of Berryville.  Minor damage was noted to a roof and shingles at a house; an electric garage door was damaged as well.  A  circular pattern was noted in the tall grass and in branches that had broken off nearby trees.  Some tomato stakes and cages were pulled up and tossed.  A fourth (small) tornado path was found from Mountville to Oatlands in western Loudoun Co.  Large branches were snapped and some trees were uprooted on a narrow path along Lime Kiln Road.Scattered tree damage was noted elsewhere across the six-county area, including the towns of Reliance (Warren Co), Middletown and Stephens City (Frederick Co), Upperville (Fauquier Co),  White Post and Berrys (Clarke Co), and from Middleburg to Arcola (Loudoun).Farther east, a steel-framed fire hall, still under construction, collapsed when a near-severe thunderstorm wind gust passed through Sterling (Loudoun Co).  Approximately 150 wooden trusses supporting the frame initially fell.  A home in the nearby Cascades subdivision had a deck collapse.  However, the deck was found to have been improperly anchored to the ground  (e.g., not according to specifications).  Based on the above evidence, and the fact that only two small trees were reported down near the fire center, wind speeds were estimated to be just under severe criteria.Lightning struck and killed two horses at a farm just north of Unison.

Several nearby trees and large limbs were also felled.The twister continued into the Army/Navy Country Club golf course, where it knocked down or snapped an estimated 50 to 60 tree limbs, some up to 2 feet in diameter.  Estimated damages at the course were around $50,000.

Afternoon temperatures were in the mid 80s with dew points in the upper 50s.  The most notable feature of this day was the strong directional shear with low-level winds from the ESE at about 20 kt through the lowest 3000 feet and mid to upper-level winds from the northwest at over 40 kt.  A weak layer of winds at about 7-10k ft MSL may have kept the environment from producing more (and stronger) supercells.,"Damage occurred just west of the Hobbs city limit where RFD and tornadic winds were superimposed.  The damage included a 15x20 ft wooden roof taken off an old shed, parts of two other roofs damaged, an awning from a trailer destroyed, a trailer pushed 3-4 feet off its foundation, and two utility poles downed.  The tornado was sighted, and a faint trail of it could be traced in the debris pattern upon inspection, but RFD winds occurred in the area as well with much of the debris blown in a divergent pattern.",PDC

Four small tornadoes were confirmed:  one in northern Shenandoah Co near the town of Wheatfield, one in extreme southeast Frederick Co in the community of Double Tollgate, a third in Clarke Co near the town of Berryville, and a fourth in Loudoun Co between Mountville and Oatlands.Damage in Wheatfield was confined to a heavily wooded rural area, where 20 trees were snapped or uprooted along a narrow but distinctive path.  Winds were estimated to be around 80 mph.  It was the first tornado ever reported in the county; perhaps partially due to a NWS survey team locating the damage.  The twister lifted along the county line, later seen as a funnel near Stephens City (Frederick Co)  before dissipating.  The second small tornado touched down east of Klines Corner in southeast Frederick Co.  Five trees were downed on one farm, and damage was spotty along a 3-mile path to Double Church Road just southwest of Double Tollgate.  A spotter had previously reported a touchdown near this area.  Most of the damage was to trees, though some minor roof and fence damage was observed along and near Double Church Road.In Clarke Co, a third tornado touched down just south of Berryville.  Minor damage was noted to a roof and shingles at a house; an electric garage door was damaged as well.  A  circular pattern was noted in the tall grass and in branches that had broken off nearby trees.  Some tomato stakes and cages were pulled up and tossed.  A fourth (small) tornado path was found from Mountville to Oatlands in western Loudoun Co.  Large branches were snapped and some trees were uprooted on a narrow path along Lime Kiln Road.Scattered tree damage was noted elsewhere across the six-county area, including the towns of Reliance (Warren Co), Middletown and Stephens City (Frederick Co), Upperville (Fauquier Co),  White Post and Berrys (Clarke Co), and from Middleburg to Arcola (Loudoun).Farther east, a steel-framed fire hall, still under construction, collapsed when a near-severe thunderstorm wind gust passed through Sterling (Loudoun Co).  Approximately 150 wooden trusses supporting the frame initially fell.  A home in the nearby Cascades subdivision had a deck collapse.  However, the deck was found to have been improperly anchored to the ground  (e.g., not according to specifications).  Based on the above evidence, and the fact that only two small trees were reported down near the fire center, wind speeds were estimated to be just under severe criteria.Lightning struck and killed two horses at a farm just north of Unison.  Earlier, lightning struck a home in Stephens City, causing $60,000 in structural damage, mainly to the roof.",,PDC

Reports of large hail, flash flooding, damaging severe winds, and four tornadoes were received.  The first tornado, and the only tornado that caused damage, moved from west of Wakita to south of Wakita in Grant County. Because the damage was limited to power poles and trees, the tornado was rated as F0. The second and third tornadoes, both brief and rated F0, were reported near Deer Creek (also in Grant County) by the county sheriff's office.  The fourth and final tornado was observed west of Blackwell in Kay County by a county spotter.  Once again, no damage resulted and the tornado was rated F0.Severe straight-line winds officially measured at up to 81 mph (near Weatherford in Custer County) caused widespread and extensive damage in portions of western Oklahoma.  Beckham and Custer Counties were particularly hard-hit with major damage in Erick, Sayre, Elk City, Arapaho, Weatherford, Binger, and Clinton. Other wind damage also occurred in Wakita and near Medford in Grant County, in Canute and Cordell in Washita County, and in Oklahoma City in Oklahoma County.The largest hail was reported southwest of Renfrow in Grant County, where hail as large as golf balls fell. Flash flooding also occurred as storms moved repeatedly across parts of north-central Oklahoma producing very heavy rain.

These touched down, then dissipated in order.The first tornado in Williamson County formed near 2:25 pm CST and built rapidly to F2 strength.  It survived for approximately 8 minutes, often returning briefly to a roped and tilted feature before it died.  This tornado was followed by a second that formed near 2:35 pm CST.  It built quickly into a multi-vortex tornado that appeared to be near F2 strength as well.  This dissipated after only 4 minutes.  The final tornado from this same supercell, , the Jarrell Tornado, developed as a small...rope-shaped tornado, touching down around 2:40 pm CST inside the Williamson County line northwest of Jarrell.  From film and eyewitness accounts, it expanded quickly into a very large vortex nearly 1/2 mile in width. Observations recounted by eyewitnesses indicated that the damage path may not have been made strictly by one tornado.  A number of eyewitnesses reported seeing several small, rope-like funnels before the character of the tornado changed drastically into the killer tornado.   Ground damage patterns in the Double Creek Subdivision also suggested this possibility. The tornado crossed CR 308, CR 305, and then CR 307.  Where the tornado crossed each of these county roads, approximately 525 feet of asphalt was ripped off each of the roadways.  This particular destruction was believed to be very close to the centerline of the tornado circulation. As the tornado crossed the intersection of  CR 305 and 307, a business on the corner was destroyed.  The tornado moved into the Double Creek area at this point with total destruction.  F5 destruction continued from shortly after its formation until very close to the end of the damage path.The tornado began a brief turn toward the southeast as it entered the Double Creek subdivision and the surrounding area, moving very slowly.  It reached the subdivision at 3:48 pm.  This time is based on a clock found at a destroyed residence in the extreme northwest corner of the subdivision and the home believed to be the first struck by the tornado.   Here, it widened to it maximum width of three-quarters of a mile.  From the air, the ground appearance changed abruptly in the vicinity of CR 308 and continued until very near the end of the path.  No definitive circulation patterns or suction spots were evident, but there was the noted obvious change in the appearance of the ground.  In the Double Creek area, approximately 40 structures were totally destroyed.  One of the most striking signs in approaching this area was the distinct lack of debris of any size.  Closer inspection showed lots of little debris but no sign of large items.  It was estimated that several dozen vehicles had been in the subdivision and removed by the tornado.  Nearly 300 cattle grazing in a pasture near the subdivision were also killed, with many of them tossed and blown for over 1/4 mile.  At least half a dozen cars were identified from the air lying in the open areas, most of them flattened and encrusted with mud and grass.  Trees in the subdivision were completely stripped of bark.  Later ground survey revealed that most of the debris that was left in the area was extremely small indicating the power of the tornadic wind.  All 27 deaths associated with the Jarrell tornado occurred in the Double Creek area.  Eyewitnesses reported that it appeared to have slowed down as it entered the subdivision, and that may account for the nearly total destruction that took place.After passing through the Double Creek area, the tornado shifted its track again slightly, moving toward the south-southwest across CR 309 and into a heavily wooded area of cedar trees.  The total destruction of the tornado ends abruptly shortly after entering the wooded area.  However, a small swath of tree damage on the north side of the main damage path suggested the possibility of a multiple vortex pattern.  No other evidence of multiple vortices was observed.The sequence of  weather phenomenon reported with this tornado was exactly opposite of that often reported- the tornado first appeared, followed by nearly calm conditions, then hail, followed by rain and finally brief, gusty winds.  This is attributed to the fact that the parent supercell was moving toward the southwest for most of its life.  The storm essentially ""backed into"" the area as it moved.",,PDC

The aerial survey did not reflect this damage as being in line with the damage path.  It is quite possible this damage was caused by strong wind near the tornado.  The beginning point was in a relatively open area with damage primarily to a few trees and minor shingle damage to one house.The tornado moved south-southwestward skirting a residential area before it crossed CR 180 immediately east of US 183.    A historic train located on the north side of CR 180 just to the east of US 183 was in the direct path of the tornado.

It also pushed large metal doors inward that were built to open toward the outside.  Damage at this point had been generally F2 with brief F3 as the tornado knocked the train tender off the track and damaged the wall and doors of the food store.  It tore off much of a weakly supported roof of a grocery store.  The manager of the store, who had been a victim of the Wichita Falls Tornado of 1979, saw the approaching tornado, and made an announcement to all in the store to meet him in the middle of the store.

In all, eight tornadoes, hail as large as golf balls, and damaging severe thunderstorm winds were reported.  No injuries or fatalities occurred as a result of the storms.The only damage reported with any of the tornadoes occurred with the first tornado 1 mile north of Cromwell in Seminole County. At this location, damage was mainly limited to outbuildings and trees and the tornado was rated F0.   Since the remaining seven tornadoes resulted in no known damage, they were also rated F0.   These tornadoes occurred in Seminole County southwest of Cromwell (17:47 CST), in Hughes County southeast of Dustin (19:00 CST), on the Johnston/Marshall County line between Russett and Madill (20:05 CST), and in Marshall County southwest of Madill (20:19 CST), south of Russett (20:20 CST), west of Little City (20:41 CST), and south of Madill (21:24 CST).In addition to the tornadoes, hail up to 1.75 inches in diameter fell in Pontotoc County northeast of Allen and in Marshall County in and north of Madill. Severe thunderstorm winds damaged trees east of Cloudy and in Cloudy in Pushmataha County. Significant structural damage was also attributed to thunderstorm winds south of Dustin in Hughes County.

These touched down, then dissipated in order.The first tornado in Williamson County formed near 2:25 pm CST and built rapidly to F2 strength.  It survived for approximately 8 minutes, often returning briefly to a roped and tilted feature before it died.  This tornado was followed by a second that formed near 2:35 pm CST.  It built quickly into a multi-vortex tornado that appeared to be near F2 strength as well.  This dissipated after only 4 minutes.  The final tornado from this same supercell, , the Jarrell Tornado, developed as a small...rope-shaped tornado, touching down around 2:40 pm CST inside the Williamson County line northwest of Jarrell.  From film and eyewitness accounts, it expanded quickly into a very large vortex nearly 1/2 mile in width. Observations recounted by eyewitnesses indicated that the damage path may not have been made strictly by one tornado.  A number of eyewitnesses reported seeing several small, rope-like funnels before the character of the tornado changed drastically into the killer tornado.   Ground damage patterns in the Double Creek Subdivision also suggested this possibility. The tornado crossed CR 308, CR 305, and then CR 307.  Where the tornado crossed each of these county roads, approximately 525 feet of asphalt was ripped off each of the roadways.  This particular destruction was believed to be very close to the centerline of the tornado circulation. As the tornado crossed the intersection of  CR 305 and 307, a business on the corner was destroyed.  The tornado moved into the Double Creek area at this point with total destruction.  F5 destruction continued from shortly after its formation until very close to the end of the damage path.The tornado began a brief turn toward the southeast as it entered the Double Creek subdivision and the surrounding area, moving very slowly.  It reached the subdivision at 3:48 pm.  This time is based on a clock found at a destroyed residence in the extreme northwest corner of the subdivision and the home believed to be the first struck by the tornado.   Here, it widened to it maximum width of three-quarters of a mile.  From the air, the ground appearance changed abruptly in the vicinity of CR 308 and continued until very near the end of the path.  No definitive circulation patterns or suction spots were evident, but there was the noted obvious change in the appearance of the ground.  In the Double Creek area, approximately 40 structures were totally destroyed.  One of the most striking signs in approaching this area was the distinct lack of debris of any size.  Closer inspection showed lots of little debris but no sign of large items.  It was estimated that several dozen vehicles had been in the subdivision and removed by the tornado.  Nearly 300 cattle grazing in a pasture near the subdivision were also killed, with many of them tossed and blown for over 1/4 mile.  At least half a dozen cars were identified from the air lying in the open areas, most of them flattened and encrusted with mud and grass.  Trees in the subdivision were completely stripped of bark.  Later ground survey revealed that most of the debris that was left in the area was extremely small indicating the power of the tornadic wind.  All 27 deaths associated with the Jarrell tornado occurred in the Double Creek area.  Eyewitnesses reported that it appeared to have slowed down as it entered the subdivision, and that may account for the nearly total destruction that took place.After passing through the Double Creek area, the tornado shifted its track again slightly, moving toward the south-southwest across CR 309 and into a heavily wooded area of cedar trees.  The total destruction of the tornado ends abruptly shortly after entering the wooded area.  However, a small swath of tree damage on the north side of the main damage path suggested the possibility of a multiple vortex pattern.  No other evidence of multiple vortices was observed.The sequence of  weather phenomenon reported with this tornado was exactly opposite of that often reported- the tornado first appeared, followed by nearly calm conditions, then hail, followed by rain and finally brief, gusty winds.  This is attributed to the fact that the parent supercell was moving toward the southwest for most of its life.  The storm essentially ""backed into"" the area as it moved.",,PDC

Four small tornadoes were confirmed:  one in northern Shenandoah Co near the town of Wheatfield, one in extreme southeast Frederick Co in the community of Double Tollgate, a third in Clarke Co near the town of Berryville, and a fourth in Loudoun Co between Mountville and Oatlands.Damage in Wheatfield was confined to a heavily wooded rural area, where 20 trees were snapped or uprooted along a narrow but distinctive path.  Winds were estimated to be around 80 mph.  It was the first tornado ever reported in the county; perhaps partially due to a NWS survey team locating the damage.  The twister lifted along the county line, later seen as a funnel near Stephens City (Frederick Co)  before dissipating.  The second small tornado touched down east of Klines Corner in southeast Frederick Co.  Five trees were downed on one farm, and damage was spotty along a 3-mile path to Double Church Road just southwest of Double Tollgate.  A spotter had previously reported a touchdown near this area.  Most of the damage was to trees, though some minor roof and fence damage was observed along and near Double Church Road.In Clarke Co, a third tornado touched down just south of Berryville.  Minor damage was noted to a roof and shingles at a house; an electric garage door was damaged as well.  A  circular pattern was noted in the tall grass and in branches that had broken off nearby trees.  Some tomato stakes and cages were pulled up and tossed.  A fourth (small) tornado path was found from Mountville to Oatlands in western Loudoun Co.  Large branches were snapped and some trees were uprooted on a narrow path along Lime Kiln Road.Scattered tree damage was noted elsewhere across the six-county area, including the towns of Reliance (Warren Co), Middletown and Stephens City (Frederick Co), Upperville (Fauquier Co),  White Post and Berrys (Clarke Co), and from Middleburg to Arcola (Loudoun).Farther east, a steel-framed fire hall, still under construction, collapsed when a near-severe thunderstorm wind gust passed through Sterling (Loudoun Co).  Approximately 150 wooden trusses supporting the frame initially fell.  A home in the nearby Cascades subdivision had a deck collapse.  However, the deck was found to have been improperly anchored to the ground  (e.g., not according to specifications).  Based on the above evidence, and the fact that only two small trees were reported down near the fire center, wind speeds were estimated to be just under severe criteria.Lightning struck and killed two horses at a farm just north of Unison.  Earlier, lightning struck a home in Stephens City, causing $60,000 in structural damage, mainly to the roof.",,PDC

Its second story sun room was destroyed by two fallen trees.  Damage also occurred to its deck and roof.  The owner estimated that nearly 95 percent of the trees on the property were either damaged or destroyed.  Most of the trees were 80 to 100 feet tall.  Damage also occurred to several homes on Hunt Valley Road.  One home had two trees on it and its siding embedded in a tree.  The tornado also moved over Sharpes Cemetery and overturned about 100 tombstones and tore down a section of its black wrought-iron fence.  About 1,600 homes lost power due to the fallen trees.

Parish officials reported 43 injuries were reported with tornado, though most were relatively minor. Six persons required and overnight stay in a hospital, including three pregnant women. Most of the damage to homes was due to large pine trees which had been toppled onto houses. In downtown Covington, a few large buildings lost roofs, had windows blown out, or suffered substantial damage. A large parish building suffered $500,000 damage. Media reports indicated cleanup would cost several million dollars. Just east of the downtown area, several cars were lifted and moved tens of feet by the tornado, and an empty tractor-trailer truck rig was blown over. Nearly 50 cars in a parking lot had their windows blown out by debris or by rapid pressure drop.

Media reports indicated cleanup would cost several million dollars. Just east of the downtown area, several cars were lifted and moved tens of feet by the tornado, and an empty tractor-trailer truck rig was blown over. Nearly 50 cars in a parking lot had their windows blown out by debris or by rapid pressure drop. The same parent thunderstorm spawned another tornado just south of Talisheek damaging a barn and a house. The damage path length at Talisheek was estimated.   American Red Cross reports indicated 69 single family homes were destroyed or had major damage in St. Tammany Parish.  Four public buildings were also heavily damaged.",,PDC

Many of the funnels came as far a half-way down before retreating up into the cloud.  While it is possible that there were other very brief touchdowns of very thin funnels, none were able to be confirmed.

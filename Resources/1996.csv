The storm rapidly intensified over western Fairfax Co, where it produced F2 damage.  The storm uprooted or snapped hundreds of trees along Pleasant Valley Road (local route 621) before moving into the Sully Station area of Centreville, where it produced estimated winds of over 130 mph.  The most impressive damage occurred along Tree Line Drive, where 11 of 17 homes incurred moderate to major damage.  Eight homes were condemned due to major damage or total destruction, including one which lost it's entire roof and back wall.  Dozens more homes sustained moderate damage, including shingle, siding, chimney, roof, and window damage.After passing through Sully Station, the twister weakened somewhat, producing F1-rated damage until just south of Fairfax City (near Burke), then weakened to F0 intensity before it was overwhelmed by straight-line winds near the Capital Beltway.The storm accelerated on an east-southeast track roughly paralleling Braddock Road.  Additional damage was incurred to residences and trees from subdivisions west of Fairfax City to just north of Burke (south of Fairfax City), continuing to the Annandale area.  The combined efforts of several agencies produced property damage estimates along the track (not including flora) to be $2.99 million.  Included in that total are 323 homes which sustained minor damage. An estimated 80 thousand homes lost power along the track of the tornado in Fairfax Co, with some homes not receiving juice until several days after the event.",,PDC

The storm rapidly intensified over western Fairfax Co, where it produced F2 damage.  The storm uprooted or snapped hundreds of trees along Pleasant Valley Road (local route 621) before moving into the Sully Station area of Centreville, where it produced estimated winds of over 130 mph.  The most impressive damage occurred along Tree Line Drive, where 11 of 17 homes incurred moderate to major damage.  Eight homes were condemned due to major damage or total destruction, including one which lost it's entire roof and back wall.  Dozens more homes sustained moderate damage, including shingle, siding, chimney, roof, and window damage.After passing through Sully Station, the twister weakened somewhat, producing F1-rated damage until just south of Fairfax City (near Burke), then weakened to F0 intensity before it was overwhelmed by straight-line winds near the Capital Beltway.The storm accelerated on an east-southeast track roughly paralleling Braddock Road.  Additional damage was incurred to residences and trees from subdivisions west of Fairfax City to just north of Burke (south of Fairfax City), continuing to the Annandale area.  The combined efforts of several agencies produced property damage estimates along the track (not including flora) to be $2.99 million.

The tornado tracked to the southeast, and moved into Braintrim Township in northwest Wyoming County around 315 PM, then Laceyville where severe tree damage was observed. A barn was destroyed with only one wall left standing. Many trees were sheared off or uprooted in town, and near the Laceyville Bridge as the tornado crossed the Susquehanna River. The tornado then moved into Windham Township at North Flats, along State Route 3001. One eyewitness was a car picked up and spun around, but the occupants were not injured.

Initial damage occurred in Tuscarora Township, where a home received extensive damage. A 25-foot trailer was tossed about one hundred feet, and a garage was completely lifted off its foundation and destroyed. The tornado tracked to the southeast, and moved into Braintrim Township in northwest Wyoming County around 315 PM, then Laceyville where severe tree damage was observed. A barn was destroyed with only one wall left standing. Many trees were sheared off or uprooted in town, and near the Laceyville Bridge as the tornado crossed the Susquehanna River. The tornado then moved into Windham Township at North Flats, along State Route 3001. One eyewitness was a car picked up and spun around, but the occupants were not injured. A mobile home was lifted off its foundation and pushed onto the street. Its occupants were unharmed. The tornado cut across a corn field and sheared off trees within a hedge row as it re-approached the Susquehanna River. Damage was spotty immediately after the tornado crossed the river northwest of Black Walnut. The next area of significant damage occurred about one-quarter mile north of Route 6, on State Route 4009, where many large trees were toppled. The tornado then moved southeast into Black Walnut where many homes were damaged on the north side of Route 6. One mobile home and several garages were completely destroyed. Nearly all of the campsites located south of Route 6, along the northern shore of the Susquehanna River, were damaged by large trees downed by the tornado. The tornado crossed the Susquehanna River once again where it downed and uprooted several hundred trees within a 100 yard swath as it moved up a steep slope. The damage path narrowed near the top of the mountain. It was undetermined whether or not damage occurred downstream from this point, but an aerial survey indicated spotty damage toward the town of Scottsville. The tornado was rated as an F1, with wind speeds between 73 and 122 MPH. The damage path was at least 6 to 7 miles long, and averaged 100 yards in width.As the storm crossed the border into Luzerne County, an F0 tornado touched down in the communities of Duryea and West Avoca. The tornado damaged several homes, with many more homes damaged by uprooted and snapped trees. A portion of these homes had roofing material blown off, gutters and siding separated.

In this span 4 homes were completely swept clean off their foundations and a couple automobiles became airborne missles for a distance of about 400 feet.  The core width of the most intense damage was about 150 to 200 yards, although at times, some secondary damage was observed in a 400 yard wide path.Oakfield residents heard local sirens about 8 minutes before the torando entered the village.

Also, a fence surrounding the back porch of an adjacent house was lifted up and over the house, then deposited in the front yard.

Many 2 to 3 foot diameter trees were uprooted and blown over, one crushing the front porch of a house and causing an injury.  A chevy blazer truck was picked up and moved about 10 feet.  Damage appeared to be in a convergent pattern with eyewitnesses sighting a rotating column extending from the cloud base.  Damage just north of this area was less extensive, consisting primarily of scattered snapped off trees.  This suggests the tornado may have lifted for a short time.  As the storm approached an area near Thompsonville Road around 820 pm on the north end of the village, it appeared the tornado touched down again.

Damage appeared to be in a convergent pattern with eyewitnesses sighting a rotating column extending from the cloud base.  Damage just north of this area was less extensive, consisting primarily of scattered snapped off trees.  This suggests the tornado may have lifted for a short time.

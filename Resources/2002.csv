The first mile of the tornado path was across open land, however the tornado produced some remarkable damage at the start. A 10X12 foot pioneer building was lifted, rotated 90 degrees, and moved 8 feet before being dropped back to the ground. At the south end of Manti, the tornado struck the Anderson Lumber business and did substantial damage. A 40 foot semi-trailer, loaded with insulation, was lifted and thrown onto it's side approximately 35 to 40 feet away. A large amount of debris, along with a 10X10 foot wooden shed, was thrown across Highway 89 and over the hill some 200 to 300 feet away. The wide swath of the tornado did considerable damage as it moved through the residential area in Southeast Manti. As the tornado exited the residential area, where some of the heaviest damage occurred, a 26 foot camp trailer was lifted and thrown to the west-northwest some 150 to 200 feet and disintegrated. The tornado continued across open farmland another half a mile or so before dissipating near the mountains. It has been determined that this was a high-end F2 tornado, with winds as high as 157 mph. The distance traveled was 2.75 miles, and the width was 800 feet. Time on the ground was approximately 15 minutes. Estimated damage is around $2,000,000, but could still go higher. Amazingly, there were no injuries.",PDS

The hurricane weakened rapidly to a Saffir Simpson Scale Category 1 Hurricane by the time it made landfall during the morning of October 3rd along the south central Louisiana coast. The hurricane continued to moved north northwest across south central Louisiana before turning northeast across the northern portion of the state.  Due to the rapid weakening, no sustained hurricane force winds were measured in southeast Louisiana.  However, storm surge was significant across the southeast Louisiana coastal areas and tidal lakes. Storm surge tides were 3 to 5 feet above normal across much of coastal southeast Louisiana except 4 to 7 feet above normal across south Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, closer to the location where the hurricane made landfall. Storm surge caused the most damage in Terrebonne Parish where many communities situated along bayous in the southern portion of the parish received considerable flooding. Storm surge also overtopped or breached several locally built drainage levees during the morning hours of October 4th. Particularly hard hit was the community of Montegut where many homes were flooded several feet deep. Over a thousand homes and businesses in Terrebonne Parish sustained some type of water damage due to storm surge. Storm surge flooding was also reported in southern Lafourche Parish where areas outside of the Larose-Golden Meadow were inundated by storm surge flooding.  Grand Isle also was hit with considerable storm surge and beach erosion. Considerable flooding of roadways and low lying structures was reported in many areas in coastal southeast Louisiana outside of the hurricane protection levees. Along Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas, low lying roadways and structures were also flooded, many having been flooded a week earlier due to Tropical Storm Isidore. No sustained hurricane force winds were measured across southeast Louisiana. Highest wind gusts recorded on October 3rd included: Houma 61 mph at 0200 CST, Paincourtville 61 mph at 0700 CST, New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport  51 mph at 0400 CST, Baton Rouge 47 mph at 1117 CST, and Mid Lake Pontchartrain Causeway 69 mph at 0530 CST.Strong wind gusts downed trees and large tree branches across much of southeast Louisiana. Property damage occurred when the trees and tree limbs fell onto houses and automobiles. In St. Tammany Parish, one man was injured when a tree fell on the mobile home in which he was living.

The tornado entered the county southwest of Cagle, then continued on to just north of Tate roughly paralleling Georgia Highway 108, then turned more eastward along Georgia Highway 53 to near Marblehill, through the Big Canoe golf course and recreation area, then east of Big Canoe into extreme western Dawson county.  There was definite evidence of F2 tornadic damage just north of Tate where winds were estimated in the 113 to 157 mph range.  Some of the hardest hit areas included homes on Pleasant Union Road near the Cherokee county border; the Mountain Lakes Estates area, where several homes suffered extensive damage; the Bethany-Salem district where at least 56 structures were damaged or destroyed; Refuge Road near Tate, the town suffering some of the greatest damage where several homes and business were destroyed; the Big Canoe area near the Dawson county border, where several homes were damaged and the tennis center suffered extensive damage.  All together, a total of 26 structures, mostly residential homes were destroyed, 142 structures were partially damaged, 2 businesses were destroyed, and 14 vehicles were totally destroyed.  In addition, ten people were injured, primarily in damaged homes or trapped in vehicles on which trees fell.  One of the businesses destroyed was the popular Davis's Barbeque on Georgia Highway 108.

The tropical storm moved steadily north across southeast Louisiana and by the afternoon of September 26 was located in central Mississippi downgraded to a tropical depression. Tropical Storm Isidore had a large circulation with tropical storm force winds extending several hundreds of miles from its center. Prior to moving onto the Yucatan Peninsula earlier in the week and weakening, Isidore was classified as a major hurricane.  Swells from the distant hurricane resulted in rip tides along the northern Gulf of Mexico, with a 41 year old man drowning on the afternoon of Sunday, Sept 22, 2002 at Port Fourchon, Lafouche Parish.    The large circulation caused a significant storm surge over a large area for a tropical storm. Tide levels were 4 to 6 feet above normal across much of southeast Louisiana from Grand Isle eastward to the Pearl River. Storm surge flooding occurred outside of the hurricane protection levees across Lafourche, Jefferson, Plaquemine, St. Bernard, and Orleans Parishes, inundating roadways and flooding some non-elevated structures. Across Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas, storm surge of 4 to 5 feet above normal were measured. Low lying areas, roadways and some non-elevated structures in parishes surrounding Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas were flooded. St. Tammany Parish was particularly hard hit with storm surge flooding when the Isidore moved north of the area, and the winds shifted to a southwest direction causing water levels to rapidly increase along the north shore  of Lake Pontchartrain on the morning of Thursday, September 26, 2000. The storm surge overtopped or breached a small local levee system in southern portions of Slidell causing water to flood several hundred homes.   Approximately 1000 homes were flooded in the parish from either storm surge, river flooding, or from flooding from heavy rainRainbands associated with Tropical Storm Isidore produced heavy rainfall in a wide area prior to and shortly after landfall. The greater New Orleans area, was particularly hard hit on the late afternoon and early evening Wednesday, September 25, 2002. Four to eight inches of rainfall occurred within 6 hours time. Drainage systems were overwhelmed by the heavy rain and numerous streets were flooded, automobiles were flooded, and water entered some homes. Portions of Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes were also hard hit during the early morning of Thursday, September 26, 2002 with homes flooded when heavy rainfall overwhelmed drainage. Between 200 and 300 homes and businesses were reported flooded in Terrebonne Parish. Storm total rainfall of 10 to 15 inches were common across southeast Louisiana. Most areas recorded sustained winds of 35 to 45 mph with some gusts to 50 mph in sqaulls. The highest wind speeds were observed near the coast or tidal lakes.  Grand Isle, on the coast, recorded the highest wind gust of 71 mph.A tornado touched down near Golden Meadow, Lafourche Parish, where a couple of sheriff's office patrol cars were damaged along with several storage buildings.The Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness reported appoximately 2500 people sought refuge in approximately 40 shelters in the state.

The first tornado spawned by this storm, an F0, touched down in Mercer County at 1:35 PM EST near the community of Hermitage (approximately 2 miles east of Sharon) and moved to the east-northeast for about 6 miles before dissipating at approximately 1:40 PM EST.  The maximum estimated winds were about 70 MPH.  Some of the damage observed from this first tornado included a downed fire tower near Hermitage.  The windward side of a barn in Jefferson Township was blown apart and the adjacent building exhibited large holes in the metal sides from flying debris.  A garage that was under construction also suffered major damage.  Numerous trees and telephone poles were either toppled or snapped along the path of the tornado.  There were also some trees toppled onto houses.  The same storm continued moving to the east-northeast and produced another tornado in Mercer County, an F1, which touched down about 5 miles northeast of Mercer near Lake Latonka at 1:45 PM EST.  It moved to the east-northeast along Routes 65 and 965, eventually crossing over into Venango County at 2:00 PM EST approximately 5 miles east of the town of Stoneboro.  The tornado continued traveling to the east-northeast in Venango County, passing just south of the town of Polk, then dissipating about 2 miles southwest of Franklin at approximately 2:06 PM EST.  Even though the tornado dissipated, sporadic downburst wind damage continued for several more miles in Venango County.  The total path length of this tornado was about 16 miles, with 10 of those miles in Mercer County and 6 miles in Venango County.  The maximum estimated winds were 105 MPH with a maximum width of about 200 yards.  In Mercer County, this tornado produced structural damage to several houses at Lake Latonka.  Also, there were several decks and porches destroyed.  Some sheds and small garages were damaged, and there were numerous trees toppled or snapped.  One boat was blown over, and siding and shingles were blown off houses.  Near Jackson Corners, there were numerous large trees downed, as well as power lines and telephone poles.  Also, several trees were toppled onto houses.  Several signs were destroyed, and roofs, siding and shingles were ripped from several houses and out-buildings.  The fish hatchery building had about a 100-square foot piece of its metal roof ripped off and thrown several hundred yards.  A relatively new garage was completely destroyed.  Also, a wooden 2x4 board was found thrown into a mobile home and pieces of wood were also driven into the front of a car.  As the tornado approached the Venango County line, the damage pattern widened considerably.  Thousands of trees and branches were snapped or toppled.  At this point the path width of damage stretched to nearly nearly one-half mile, as the tornado track was joined by microburst damage.In Venango County, this tornado caused minor damage to 3 homes; moderate damage to another, and totally destroyed 4 barns.  There were also 2 tree farms that suffered major damage and one-half of a double-wide mobile home was turned completely over onto its roof.",,PDS

The first tornado spawned by this storm, an F0, touched down in Mercer County at 1:35 PM EST near the community of Hermitage (approximately 2 miles east of Sharon) and moved to the east-northeast for about 6 miles before dissipating at approximately 1:40 PM EST.  The maximum estimated winds were about 70 MPH.  Some of the damage observed from this first tornado included a downed fire tower near Hermitage.  The windward side of a barn in Jefferson Township was blown apart and the adjacent building exhibited large holes in the metal sides from flying debris.  A garage that was under construction also suffered major damage.  Numerous trees and telephone poles were either toppled or snapped along the path of the tornado.  There were also some trees toppled onto houses.  The same storm continued moving to the east-northeast and produced another tornado in Mercer County, an F1, which touched down about 5 miles northeast of Mercer near Lake Latonka at 1:45 PM EST.  It moved to the east-northeast along Routes 65 and 965, eventually crossing over into Venango County at 2:00 PM EST approximately 5 miles east of the town of Stoneboro.  The tornado continued traveling to the east-northeast in Venango County, passing just south of the town of Polk, then dissipating about 2 miles southwest of Franklin at approximately 2:06 PM EST.  Even though the tornado dissipated, sporadic downburst wind damage continued for several more miles in Venango County.  The total path length of this tornado was about 16 miles, with 10 of those miles in Mercer County and 6 miles in Venango County.  The maximum estimated winds were 105 MPH with a maximum width of about 200 yards.  In Mercer County, this tornado produced structural damage to several houses at Lake Latonka.  Also, there were several decks and porches destroyed.  Some sheds and small garages were damaged, and there were numerous trees toppled or snapped.  One boat was blown over, and siding and shingles were blown off houses.  Near Jackson Corners, there were numerous large trees downed, as well as power lines and telephone poles.  Also, several trees were toppled onto houses.  Several signs were destroyed, and roofs, siding and shingles were ripped from several houses and out-buildings.  The fish hatchery building had about a 100-square foot piece of its metal roof ripped off and thrown several hundred yards.  A relatively new garage was completely destroyed.  Also, a wooden 2x4 board was found thrown into a mobile home and pieces of wood were also driven into the front of a car.  As the tornado approached the Venango County line, the damage pattern widened considerably.  Thousands of trees and branches were snapped or toppled.  At this point the path width of damage stretched to nearly nearly one-half mile, as the tornado track was joined by microburst damage.In Venango County, this tornado caused minor damage to 3 homes; moderate damage to another, and totally destroyed 4 barns.  There were also 2 tree farms that suffered major damage and one-half of a double-wide mobile home was turned completely over onto its roof.",,PDS

This severe storm moved east at 45 MPH, damaging property all of the way to the Potomac River.  This same storm later produced a devastating F4 tornado in La Plata, MD.  While the storm moved through North Central Virginia, it produced an F2 tornado in Shenandoah County, a significant funnel cloud in Fauquier County, large hail, heavy downpours, and scattered wind damage.  In Shenandoah County, an F2 tornado touched down just east of Quicksburg near the intersection of Quicksburg Road and Old Bridge Road.  The tornado stayed on the ground for 4 miles before it dissipated while moving up the west side of Massanutten Mountain.  The twister was estimated to be about 75 yards wide and it caused a total of $1.6 million in damage.  Along the path of the tornado, three residential structures were destroyed, 12 structures were heavily damaged, and 15 had minor damage.  Four poultry houses and 15 barns were destroyed.  Five poultry houses, two silos, and a mile of fencing was also damaged.  On Old Bridge Road, a silo and three barns were damaged.  Airborne roof debris and high winds hit a tractor-trailer on I-81 and caused it to flip onto its side.  The driver of the tractor-trailer was treated for minor injuries.  The tornado moved across I-81 and Route 11 into the Kay Hill subdivision.  Homes were damaged and trees were downed on Lower and Upper Forge Road.  A mobile home on Mantz Drive was destroyed.  The tornado moved east across Smith Creek to Smith Creek Road and Franwood Lane where it caused significant damage.  A two-story home just off Smith Creek Road was severely damaged by debris from a neighbor's 60-foot-high grain silo.  A woman inside the structure was treated for bruises.  On Franwood Lane, two turkey houses were destroyed and four were severely damaged.  One dog that lived on the property was killed and another was injured.  A cat was never found.  A shed was damaged and work equipment was scattered across the property.  At Franwood Farms Airport, 5 people took shelter from the storm in a hangar.  A person in the hangar said the walls kept coming closer together as the tornado approached and eventually the roof blew off the building.  The tornado also flipped a plane on the landing strip.  The tornado's path was visible up to two miles east of Franwood Farms through a path of damaged trees in the forest.  The path of tree damage ended as the topography sloped up Massanutten Mountain into George Washington National Forest.  In addition, an orchard west of Mt. Jackson just north of the tornado's path, sustained hail damage. In Rockingham County, dime sized hail fell in Bergton for ten minutes.  In Page County, golf ball sized hail fell in Rileyville.  Power lines were downed in Stanley.  In Culpeper County, a tree was downed onto Route 522 near Route 633 in Norman.  In Fauquier County, a funnel cloud was photographed by a meteorologist on a hill near Fauquier Springs.  The time series of photos shows the funnel never reaching the ground.  High winds downed a large tree and utility poles onto Harts Mill and Spriggs roads about 5 miles west of Warrenton.  In New Baltimore, dime sized hail was reported.  In Prince William County, quarter sized hail fell in Woodbridge and Manassas.  Golf ball sized hail caused property damage in Dale City.  A total of 2.20 inches of rain fell in Canova as the storm passed through.","A tornado injured 2 people, destroyed 4 homes, damaged 56 additional homes and 36 agricultural structures, downed numerous trees, and blew over a tractor-trailer on Interstate 81.",PDS

The tornadoes it produced left a 64 mile path of destruction ranging from F1 to F4 damage.  Five people were killed, 122 were injured, and over $115 million in damage was reported. The tornadoes were spawned from a supercell thunderstorm that crossed the Potomac River from Prince William County.  Up to 10 miles north of the path of the tornado, large hail up to 4.5 inches in diameter fell.  Debris from the tornado was found as far away as southern Delaware.  Wind damage was also reported near the path of the storm.Across Charles County, 638 homes were damaged, 100 homes were destroyed, 143 businesses (mainly in downtown La Plata) were damaged, and 49 businesses were destroyed.  Countless trees and agricultural buildings were downed along the rural path of the storm.  Three people were killed and at least 120 people were injured countywide, 12 critically.  A 51-year-old man was killed and his wife was critically injured when their house under construction on Hawkins Gate Road, about 5 miles east of La Plata, collapsed.  A 54-year-old man died in his car from an apparent heart attack at the intersection of Route 301 and Route 6 in downtown La Plata.  The third victim, a 72-year-old woman, died of a heart attack in Waldorf after being frightened by the tornado.  The tornado first touched down on the eastern edge of General Smallwood State Park just north of Rison.  It pushed east-southeast and passed just south of Pisgah where it grew to F2 strength.  The tornado moved through Mount Pisgah and damaged homes on Ripley Road between Ripley and Garden Estates.  The twister continued to move east through rural lands south of Hawthorne Road (Route 255) passing just north of the community of Graystone.  Next, it moved through the communities of Habre de Venture, Longmeade, Clamber Hill, Hawthorne Manor, and Hillendale about 3 miles west of downtown La Plata.  The tornado, now F3 strength, hit the western portion of La Plata next, moving directly through the neighborhoods of Valley View, Morgan's Ridge, Quailwood, and Haldane.  The tornado, now F4 strength, continued east into the downtown area where it crossed through the intersection of Route 301 and 6.  Damage was found on either side of Route 6 with the most severe devastation occurring on the south side of the highway.  The downtown business district was nearly wiped out after 65% of the buildings were either heavily damaged or destroyed.  The 125-foot city water tower was also downed.

Amateur radio operators measured wind gusts to 71 mph in Easthampton and to 59 mph in West Springfield as the storms moved through.  In the city of Boston,winds estimated near 60 mph blew down scaffolding on a school building, while in Salem winds of similar magnitude ripped siding off a house.A tornado briefly touched down in West Brookfield at 315 pm, and there were no injuries reported.  The tornado had an approximate path width of 75 yards, a path length of about one-half mile, and was only on the ground for about 30 seconds, as determined by a National Weather Service survey of the area.  The intensity of the tornado was determined to be an F1 on the Fujita damage scale, which corresponds to wind speeds between 73 and 112 mph.  It is likely that winds were closer to the upper region of that range.  The tornado formed over the northeast portion of Lake Wickaboag and traveled to the east, dissipating just to the east of the portion of Wickaboag Valley Road that is adjacent to the lake.  Microburst damage was evident for about another two miles east of where the tornado circulation ended.Eyewitnesses reported that a curtain of water was drawn from the lake as high as 50 feet into the air, and traveled east.  A portion of it hit a house by the lake, causing its roof to fly off and become embedded to a tree across the street.  There was also a brief flash as power lines were downed on Wickaboag Valley Road.  Although most downed trees were facing southwest to northeast, there was some evidence of trees blown down to the north and northwest near the lake.The same thunderstorm was responsible for another microburst in Spencer.  Large trees were uprooted, some of which landed on cars and houses.  Wind speeds were estimated to be near 100 mph based upon the damage observed.Another severe thunderstorm produced a microburst in Concord, as determined by a National Weather Service survey, which occurred between 345 and 400 pm.  Straight line winds on Monument Street were estimated near 75 mph.  Numerous large trees were snapped off and uprooted, which in turn knocked down many electric poles and wires.  A couple of large trees were snapped off, and fell on a house on Monument Street.  The microburst was approximately one-half mile wide and about one and a half miles long.",Brief F1 touchdown,PDS

In addition, there were strong and divergent winds aloft.  All of these parameters set the stage for the largest widespread severe event in eastern New York State in exactly four years.  Including adjacent New England, 42 warnings were issued  from the Albany office, and nearly as many severe events took place.  While most of the events were strong winds associated with the thunderstorms, large hail was reported and two tornados confirmed by a National Weather Service Team.  A line of thunderstorms first entered  Herkimer County, where numerous trees fell in the town of  Ilion. Then, the first of two seperate tornados briefly touched down in Johnstown, Fulton County. That tornado was ranked as a F1 on the Fujita scale with top winds estimated around 100 mph, a width of 25 yards and a path length of about a tenth of a mile. The tornado damaged an old movie theater in that town by tearing the roof off and blowing out the supporting back brick wall. The debris was thrown up to a third of a mile away. Thunderstorm downburst winds also toppled 2/3 of WENT radio's tower and destroyed a wide swath of trees, 8-18 inches in diameter, from about a 1/2 mile southeast of Johnstown to about 1/2 of a mile across Route 30A. Many roads were temporarily closed in and around Johnstown as the result of  downed and uprooted trees and large limbs. As the line of storms progressed to the east, minor to moderate wind damage, mainly downed trees and power lines, were noted at various places in Albany, Washington,Warren, Saratoga Schenectady, Schoharie, Columbia, Montgomery, and Rensselaer, Counties. In Dutchess County, in addition to scattered downed trees and wires countywide, a car was crushed by a tree near Poughkeepsie. Ulster County was especially hard hit, with trees and power lines reported down countywide. The second confirmed tornado touched down at Whaley Lake in southeast Dutchess County. This tornado was also ranked between an F0/F1 on the Fujita scale with winds estimated around 75 mph and witnessed by a skywarn spotter.  This tornado was about 100 yards wide and had a length of approximately half a mile. Damage was mainly confined to many downed and twisted trees, but one large tree did fall on a small house near the lake and damaged the roof. The tree size ranged between 8 and 24 inches in diameter. Dime-size hail was first reported in Johnstown, Fulton County from a second distinct thunderstorm cell. Hail, as large as 1.75 inches fell in New Paltz, Ulster County .  In Dutchess County, dime-size hail fell at Salt Point, while one inch hail was reported at Wingdale (very close to the tornado touchdown) and 1.25 inch hail was noted in Poughkeepsie. One and three quarter inch size hail was reported. The thunderstorms knocked out  power to about 9,000 customers in eastern New  York, with nearly a third of these in the  Mohawk Valley.

In addition, there were strong and divergent winds aloft.  All of these parameters set the stage for the largest widespread severe event in eastern New York State in exactly four years.  Including adjacent New England, 42 warnings were issued  from the Albany office, and nearly as many severe events took place.  While most of the events were strong winds associated with the thunderstorms, large hail was reported and two tornados confirmed by a National Weather Service Team.  A line of thunderstorms first entered  Herkimer County, where numerous trees fell in the town of  Ilion. Then, the first of two seperate tornados briefly touched down in Johnstown, Fulton County. That tornado was ranked as a F1 on the Fujita scale with top winds estimated around 100 mph, a width of 25 yards and a path length of about a tenth of a mile. The tornado damaged an old movie theater in that town by tearing the roof off and blowing out the supporting back brick wall. The debris was thrown up to a third of a mile away. Thunderstorm downburst winds also toppled 2/3 of WENT radio's tower and destroyed a wide swath of trees, 8-18 inches in diameter, from about a 1/2 mile southeast of Johnstown to about 1/2 of a mile across Route 30A. Many roads were temporarily closed in and around Johnstown as the result of  downed and uprooted trees and large limbs. As the line of storms progressed to the east, minor to moderate wind damage, mainly downed trees and power lines, were noted at various places in Albany, Washington,Warren, Saratoga Schenectady, Schoharie, Columbia, Montgomery, and Rensselaer, Counties. In Dutchess County, in addition to scattered downed trees and wires countywide, a car was crushed by a tree near Poughkeepsie. Ulster County was especially hard hit, with trees and power lines reported down countywide. The second confirmed tornado touched down at Whaley Lake in southeast Dutchess County. This tornado was also ranked between an F0/F1 on the Fujita scale with winds estimated around 75 mph and witnessed by a skywarn spotter.  This tornado was about 100 yards wide and had a length of approximately half a mile. Damage was mainly confined to many downed and twisted trees, but one large tree did fall on a small house near the lake and damaged the roof. The tree size ranged between 8 and 24 inches in diameter. Dime-size hail was first reported in Johnstown, Fulton County from a second distinct thunderstorm cell. Hail, as large as 1.75 inches fell in New Paltz, Ulster County .  In Dutchess County, dime-size hail fell at Salt Point, while one inch hail was reported at Wingdale (very close to the tornado touchdown) and 1.25 inch hail was noted in Poughkeepsie. One and three quarter inch size hail was reported. The thunderstorms knocked out  power to about 9,000 customers in eastern New  York, with nearly a third of these in the  Mohawk Valley. Despite all the severe weather, no weather-related casualities were reported to the National Weather Service.",,PDS

Just about every type of weather phenomena was observed: a tornado; a funnel cloud; powerful, hurricane-force, downburst winds that uprooted trees and damaged buildings; torrential rains reducing visibilities to 100 feet; urban and small stream flooding; numerous lightning strikes - some that resulted in fire damage; and the early stages of a ground-based vortex that never made it to tornado status.  Clusters and short lines of thunderstorms ahead of a cold front eventually merged into a single complex that moved west to east across southern Wisconsin.  Surface dewpoints were in the lower 70s and maximum afternoon temperatures were in the mid to upper 80s.  At least 56,000 customers in southeast Wisconsin lost electrical power thanks to lightning strikes, and tree damage to power lines.  One of the worst lightning strikes was in Fox Point (Milwaukee Co.), where a lightning fire burned a home to the ground.  In the city of Racine (Racine Co.), lightning blew a home's windows out. Near Rewey (Iowa Co.), the thunderstorm winds blew the roof of a building, and flattened a farm shed.  Just southwest of Lamont (Lafayette Co.), the winds blew an attached garage off a home, demolished an old barn whose pieces were pushed onto a road, and leveled several large trees.  North of Baraboo (Sauk Co.), the winds pushed a tree on to a home, and damaged siding and cables on another home.  A weak F0 tornado spun up in the rural area north-northwest of Oakfield (Fond du Lac Co.), but damage was limited to vegetation.  The discussion on this tornado can be found as a separate August 21, 2002 episode in this publication.  About 3 miles southeast of Oakfield, a gustnado (Thunderstorm Wind event) with estimated wind speeds of 61 to 70 kts (70 to 80 mph) tore off a pole shed's roof, demolished yard furniture, and severely damaged another building.  Some corn crop was also damaged.  Based on WSWR-88D imagery, it appears that the convergence of two gust fronts initiated the gustnado.  North-northeast of Monroe (Green Co.) a shed was blown onto a road and further northeast near Albany a farm wagon was blown on to a road.  Partial roof damage occurred southwest of Albion (Dane Co.) as the storms moved through.  A trained spotter on the west shore of Rock Lake in the city of Lake Mills (Jefferson Co.) observed a circulation whip up 3-foot tall waves with white caps on the lake while also observing a wall cloud above.  This vortex never spun up to cloud base, which would have classified it a tornado.  No damage was noted.   A weak gustnado on a gust front, with estimated winds of 52 to 61 kts (60 to 70 mph) damaged some corn and trees just 1/4 mile to the west of the Milwaukee/Sullivan NWS office east of Rome.  An incredibly powerful macroburst tore through the area from just northeast of the Waukesha County airport northeastward through Pewaukee to that part of Brookfield east of Capital Drive Airport.  Estimated wind speeds reach 100 mph based on a measured gust of 98 mph at a home south of Green Rd. near Duplainville, in the Town of Brookfield.  At the intersection of I-94 and Hwy T, the steel support posts for road signs were twisted by the winds.  At least 8 homes southeast of Duplainville had damage ranging from blown-out windows and damaged chimneys to roof damage, toppled street lights, and a demolished garage.  One house was slightly shifted off it foundation; obviously it wasn't well-anchored to its foundation.   In the city of Brookfield there were two localized areas where large trees were uprooted: in the Camelot Park area and in the Beverly Hills Park area.  A large tree fell onto a home's screened porch, resulting in severe damage.  A couple other homes had some minor gutter,  siding, and window damage as large tree branches scraped the sides while falling.  The powerful winds also hit Milwaukee County hard.  An estimated wind gust of at least 70 kts (80 mph) ripped a 100-foot long blimp from its mooring at Timmerman Field, allowing the blimp to fly about 6 blocks and damage 4 homes on impact.  The winds blew water through the flaps that cover the edges of the retractable roof panels of Miller Park in Milwaukee, resulting in a saturated playing field, and some wet spectators.  In Cudahy an eight-car garage's roof was removed by the winds, and 3 stalls collapsed, based on Amateur Radio reports.  A picnic shelter and several other garages and businesses on College Ave. near Lake Michigan also sustained some damage.  In the city of South Milwaukee, a business's sign and fence were destroyed by the winds.  Another powerful hurricane-force microburst moved northeast through Sturtevant (Racine Co.) through the north side of the city of Racine to Wind Point.  The roof of an apartment building in Racine was partially ripped off by the winds.  In addition, large trees were uprooted and several other homes suffered slight damage from felled trees and tree branches.  Farther west in the Waterford area, a 2-story tall grain bin was lifted off the ground and moved 15 feet by the winds, while nearby large trees were damaged.Torrential rainfalls up to the rate of 1 inch in 15 to 20 minutes were common with many of the storms, resulting in scattered areas of urban and small stream flooding.  The rainfall rate at one location in the city of Milwaukee peaked at over 6 inches per hour!  Combined late-afternoon and evening rainfall totals reached 1 to 3 inches across much of south-central and southeast Wisconsin.  The southern part of Lafayette County near the Illinois border received up to 5 to 6 inches of rain (based on WSR-88D Doppler radar rainfall estimates) due to repeated rounds of thunderstorms moving west to east across that area.  In Gratiot, 4.10 inches were measured, but this location was north of the area that had greater amounts.  Just across the border in the northwestern Illinois counties of Jo Daviess and Stephenson spotters measured over 10 inches of rain!  Luckily for Lafayette County, which has hilly terrain, the rains came in several rounds and resulted in only urban/small stream flooding, rather than flash flooding.","A weak tornado spun up in the rural area north-northwest of Oakfield, just east-southeast of the intersection of Hwy 151 and TC.  It moved east-southeast and crossed Hwy Y before dissipating.  A few trees were uprooted and some grasses were flattened. Wind speeds, based on damage to vegetation, was estimated about 52 to 61 kts (60 to 70 mph).  Amateur Radio operators who observed this weak tornado noted that one had to be within 100 yards of the vortex in order to see it due to rain-wrapping and haze.",PDS

Rainfall totals were in the 2 to 4 range.  In addition, gust winds of 35 to 43 kts (40 to 50 mph) accompanied the storms, resulting in broken tree branches.  On the south side of the city of Waukesha, 1.5 inches of rain fell in 20 minutes in the afternoon, once again sending small streams out of their banks and allowing water to accumulate in low-lying areas.  The 2-day rain total at this location near the corner of Hwy 164 and CTY I was 8.80 inches!  Also on the 13th in the afternoon, 3.4 inches of rain fell at the home of an Amateur Radio operator in the southeast part of the city of Milwaukee.  Urban flooding resulted.  Some closed roads in both Waukesha and Milwaukee Counties had 3 feet of water on them.  Urban flooding affected the Port Washington area (Ozaukee Co.) after about 2 inches of rain fell in about 75 minutes during the afternoon hours.  A couple roads were closed in that city.  Urban flooding was also reported in Ft. Atkinson (Jefferson Co.) after the tornado event.  Heavy rains in this city produced swift currents that knocked a boy down, sending him through a culvert. He was rescued by the Fire Department, and treated for slight injuries.","A weak tornado spun up 1.8 miles southwest of Ft. Atkinson near the Rock River, and proceeded to move east-southeast across the far southern parts of the city to just north of the intersection of Hwy 89 and M, and then across rural, farm locations to a point just west of N about .5 mile north of Cold Spring.  Maximum wind speeds were estimated to be in the 52 to 61 kts (60 to 70) mph range based on F0 damage left behind.  Some light damage to shingles and siding was noted on several residential homes.  Several large trees were uprooted, and loose lumber and debris was picked up at a lumber yard.  At other locations along the path, lawn furniture and other objects were overturned or displaced.  Eyewitness reports indicated that the condensation funnel was not visible all the way to the ground, but they noted that dirt was ingested into the circulation, thereby making the tornado visible at ground level.  There were no fatalities or injuries.  Meteorologically, the tornado was the result of two  thunderstorm cells, in a line of storms along a cold front, merging just southwest of Ft. Atkinson.
